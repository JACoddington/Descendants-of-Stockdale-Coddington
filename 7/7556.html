<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"SANFORD S. CODDINGTON is successfully engaged in agricultural pursuits in Oakland township, Susquehanna County, and is also serving as a justice of the peace, a position which he fills with credit to himself and to the entire satisfaction of the general public. He is thoroughly impartial in meting out justice, his opinions being unbiased by either fear or favor, and his fidelity to the trust reposed in him is above question. <br>Mr. Coddington was born in Bridgeville, Sullivan Co., N. Y., in June 1858, and is the son of Benjamin S. and Martha J. (Miller) Coddinton, also natives of that State, the former born in Burlington, Ulster county, and the latter in Orange county. <br>During the Civil war the father enlisted in the 123rd N. Y. V. I., and was in service for three years and three months, doing his duty as a faithfull soldier. After his marriage he lived for a short time in Orange county, N. Y., and then moved to Bridgeville, Sullivan county, where he worked at the blacksmith's trade for a number of years. After the war he bought property in Glen Wild, Sullivan county, where he made his home until his death, which occurred in March, 1866. He left his wife with six children, and as a true mother she reared them in a most careful manner at her home in Glen Wild. She now resides with one of her sons at Circleville, Orange Co., New York. <br>The children were as follows: (1) John, born in Orange county, married Libbie Smith, of Sullivan county, N. Y., and located in Brownville, where he died, leaving one son, H. S., now a resident of Susquehanna, Penn., who is married and has a son ---Harold. (2) William born in Ulster county, N. Y., married Rachel Dowlway, of Orange county, and located in Circleville, where she died, leaving one daughter, Nellie, now the wife of Frank Brown. For his second wife William Coddington married Maggie Decker, of Orange county, N. Y., by whom he has two children--Emma and Ira. He now resides in Pine Bush, N. Y., where he owns a fine property. (3) Minnie, born in Sullivan county, N. Y., married Luther Weld, of that county, and they now live on his farm in Fair Oaks, Orange county. They have three children: Jennie, wife of Judson Gillen, of Fair Oaks; Freddie and Luther, both at home. (4) Eugene, born in Bridgeville, Sullivan county, married Lizzie Lozall, of Circleville, N. Y., where he now follows farming. (5) Frank, born in Sullivan county, was principally educated in the schools of Glen Wild and is now engaged in business as a carpenter and builder, making his home with his mother in Circleville. He married Mary Babcock, of Orange county. <br>Sandford S. Coddington, the subject of this sketch, completes the family. He was only eight years old when his father died, but remained with his mother until old enough to start out in life for himself, his education being obtained in the schools of Glen Wild. He first worked as a farm hand by the month, and during early life also picked up a good knowledge of the blacksmith's trade, which he followed to some extent. In 1880 he was united in marriage with Miss Amelia Miller, of Orange county, N. Y., daughter of Levi and Araminta (Travis) Miller. Her father, who is a farmer by occupation, is a representative of an old and prominent family of Wallkill, Orange county. Our subject and his wife have two children: Frank M., who was born in Susquehanna, Penn., in October 1881; and Cora M., born in Oakland, in December, 1883. Both are now students in the home schools. <br>After his marriage Mr. Coddington located in Susquehanna, Penn., where for a year and a half he worked at the carpenter's and mason's trades, and then, in 1883, purchased the A. K. Perine farm in Oakland township, Susquehanna county. Until 1897 he devoted considerable attention to the dairy and milk business, which he disposed of during that year, and has since successfully engaged in general farming. He has remodeled his barns and erected new buildings upon the place, and the neat and thrifty appearance of the farm plainly indicates his careful supervision and shows him to be a man who thoroughly understands his chosen calling. He being honest, upright and industrious he has become the owner of a good property. Politically he follows in the footsteps of his father, always voting the Republican ticket, and in 1896 he was elected justice of the peace in Oakland township for a term of five years. Religiously he and his wife are faithful members of the North Jackson Methodist Episcopal Church, and socially he belongs to Cannawacta Tribe, No. 246, I. O. R. M., of Susquehanna." <A HREF="../sources.html#2112"><sup>2112</sup></a></font></p>
