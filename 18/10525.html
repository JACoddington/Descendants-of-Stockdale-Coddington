<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"The first mention of Edward Bobet on record in this country is at Plymouth, where under date of 1643 we find his name among fifty-four others in a list of those between sixteen and sixty years of age, who are able to bear arms. From this we know that he was over sixteen years of age at this date, and presumably barely that age, since he does not appear in any earlier records of this nature."<br>"His next appearance is in the Plymouth Court records, the charge against him being an example of the strict discipline of those days;<br>"At the General Court holden at Plymouth aforesaid, the sixt day of June 1649, xxx presentments of the Grand Inquest. xxx Wee present Edward Bobbit, of Taunton, for receiving pay for stollen weapon." xxx<br>CLEARED<br>"Upon the margin of the same page, against the name of Edward Bobet, and opposite the charge is the official entry "Cleared".<br><br>and...<br><br>"We have now come to that time of terror and disaster to the settlers, the uprising of the Indians, known as King Philip's War. It can be imagined how many anxious hours were passed by Edward and Sarah Bobet, so far removed from the garrison stockade, with their large family of children. Judging by the quantities of Indian relics found on his home farm, it would be possible that it was a favorite haunt of the Indians before Edward Bobet purchased the land." <br>"On June 25, 1675, Edward and his family were warned of the commencement of hostilities. They took refuge in the fort at Taunton, leaving behind the home which had been the fruit of much labor in the wilderness. We must depend on tradition for an account of Edward Bobet's last hours. This tradition has been faithfully handed down from generation to generation and seems to be confirmed by the place of his burial. According to this tradition, Edward Bobet, returned to his home to secure some necessary articles. He was accompanied by his dog, in the thought that the dog would give him a warning of any prowling Indians. He obtained the articles and was on his way back to the fort when he discovered that he was being pursued by Indians. He climbed a tree and was effectually hidden, but his faithful dog, disclosed his presence in the tree and his life was the forfeit of his hazardous adventure. His grave is in a private yard, near Berkley Bridge, and is thought to be the spot where he was killed. The spot was marked by a bronze memorial tablet in 1911, it's cost being defrayed by small contributions from his many descendants from the United States and Canada."<br>''When Edward failed to return to the fort, the searching party, buried his mutilated body where it was found, and later a headstone was placed there. The headstone is now in the Historical Hall of Taunton, Massachusetts, it having been taken away from the grave afterwards and placed on a stone wall near by. This old stone reads;<br>Edward Bobbett <br>Kld June 1675<br>"In 1684, at the widow Sarah's request, Edward Bobet Junior, was appointed to administer his father's estate and made guardian to the minor children."<br>William Bradford Browne considered his history to be complete for the first six generations, although he included more than the first six generations <A HREF="../sources.html#4861"><sup>4861</sup></a></font></p>
