<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Bookkeeper. Methodist.<br>"Robert K. Coddington. It is not within the capability of every man to be successful both as an employee and an employer. Certain characteristics are necessary in order that a man may faithfully represent capital and labor. He must be fair in his judgments, upright in his actions, and open to argument, and cautious in making decisions until all sides of every question have been presented. It is the possession of these qualities that has made Robert K. Coddington successful in the discharge of his duties in the traffic department of the American Rolling Mill company, at Middletown. He is a native of Amanda, Ohio, born December 12, 1868, a son of James and Nancy (Edwards) Coddington, and a descendant of the family to which belonged William Coddington, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island. His paternal grandfather was Robert Coddington, who married a Miss Sinkey, and his maternal grandfather was Samuel Edwards, who came from Maryland to Cincinnati, Ohio, at an early date in the latter city's history. There were seven children in the family of Mr. Coddington's parents: Robert K., Samuel, Charles, Rowena, Clinton, William and Charles, of whom William is deceased. The father passed away in 1888, and the mother survives as a resident of Amanda. Robert K. Coddington attended the public schools of his native place, and after his graduation from the high school began to teach in the country schools. From that occupation he went to become agent of the C. H. &amp; D. railroad, at West Middletown, but resigned to accept one with the Decatur Buggy company. From that concern he transferred his services to the American Tobacco company, and subsequently joined the American Rolling Mill, at Middletown, Ohio. Mr. Coddington is liberal in his political views, and his religious faith is that of the Methodist church. December 25, 1894, he married Miss Jennie Gillespie, who is still a woman of striking beauty and of lovely personality. She was born at Franklin, Ohio, October 22, 1869, a daughter of the late Capt. J. W. A. and Henrietta (Wilkinson) Gillespie. Captain Gillespie was born in Muskingum county, Ohio, February 19, 1837, a son of James and Catherine Gillespie, and was married at Franklin to Henrietta Wilkinson, who was born April 26, 1842, at Franklin, daughter of Richard and Mary Jane Wilkinson. He was in the Union service from April 19, 1861, to January 1, 1865, served as storekeeper for the United States Government for six months in 1868, and was sergeant-at-arms of the G. A. R. Post at Columbus, Ohio, for a number of years. His death occurred at Middletown. He and his wife were the parents of five children: Edwin P., Frank, Jennie T., William F. and Robert Y. An elder brother of Captain Gillespie, William C. B. Gillespie, was captain and later major of the 41st Illinois Volunteers, and was subsequently on staff duty with Generals Pugh and Custer. George, another brother, fought with the 9th Ohio Cavalry. Mr. and Mrs. Coddington have reared a most interesting family of children. Paul Edward fought as a member of the United States Marines for two years and four months and while in France, June 8, 1918, was wounded by a machine-gun bullet in the head and right arm, while in the engagement of Belleau Wood. His cousin, Frohman Gillespie and Uncle Charles Coddington, also were in the U. S. service. Thelma, the elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Coddington, is a graduate of the Middletown High school, and volunteered as a Red Cross nurse. Marian Loeta, the younger daughter, is also a graduate of Middletown High school and also attended Monmouth college. She is splendidly gifted with dramatic talent, and while she has never trod the professional boards her services are constantly in demand in amateur entertainments and home talent theatricals. She is self-supporting, being employed in the office of the American Rolling Mill company. Kyle, the younger son and youngest child, is a member of the sophomore class at the Middletown High school." <A HREF="../sources.html#1673"><sup>1673</sup></a></font></p>
