<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Inventor and General Mechanic (See records at U.S. Patent Office). Baptist.  Republican.  (per Rev. Herbert G. Coddington).<br>"George D. C. Coddington. Inventive genius is a divine gift, and its exercise, along useful and humanitarian lines, has done much to add to the comfort and happiness of the world. In connection with utilitarian inventions, the name of Coddington is one which has long been prominent. The late George W. Coddington, whose name and memory preserved in the firm of George W. Coddington heirs, at West Middletown, was a man of rare genius, and his son, George D. C. Coddington, is one whose natural talents and practical application of expert knowledge have placed him beyond ordinary characterization, in several instances having practically revolutionized mechanical methods. Mr. Coddington was born at Middletown, Ohio, February 13, 1869, a son of George W. and Ruth J. (Doty) Coddington, and is a direct descendant of Daniel Doty, the first white settler of Butler county. His paternal grandfather, Stephen Coddington, came from Maryland down the Ohio river and settled at what is now Cincinnati, then Fort Washington, where he followed the trade of mason and also did some freighting down the Ohio river. His son, George W. Coddington, was born at Cincinnati, and as a young man went to Missouri, but about the close of the Civil war came to Middletown and settled on Clinton street. During his residence in Missouri his eyesight had become impaired, but upon his recovery he applied himself to the trade of mason, and later took up photography. He was likewise skilled in the art of violin making, and numerous fine instruments came from his little shop, several of which are still in the family possession. He easily displayed inventive genius, his first practical article of value being a patent truck for holding logs in a sawmill. Following this came a steam turbine, which also attracted favorable attention. His principal invention, however, was a waxed string for fruit jars and the machinery to manufacture same, and out of this he made a large fortune, following it with a glass fruit jar which bears his name. Among his other accomplishments, Mr. Coddington was a fancy skater of note and retained his skill in this direction until he had passed his seventieth year. He married Ruth J. Doty, who was born and reared southeast of Middletown, a daughter of Joseph and Mary (Vail) Doty, the former of whom was the first proprietor of Middletown and laid out the streets of that city. Daniel Doty, the grandfather of Mrs. Coddington, was the first settler of Butler county, where he arrived in 1796. He commenced his improvements in a dense forest, and built his primitive log cabin on the banks of the Big Miami, but when it was finished had to make his household effects of every kind with which to furnish it. This cabin, which was long a landmark of the community, had wooden pegs for nails and a clapboard roof. In later life, this pioneer had a more comfortable and commodious home, and was one of the respected and influential men of his locality. He and his wife were the parents of twelve children, of whom the ninth in order of birth was Joseph, who was born at Middletown, January 8, 1808. He married Mary Vail, daughter of Samuel Vail, who was a brother of Stephen Vail, the first proprietor of Middletown. In the family of George W. Coddington, there were five children, of whom two survive: George D. C.; and Pearl, the wife of William Rosscopf, of Imperial valley, Calif. George D. C. Coddington was educated in the public schools of Middletown, and in his youth showed flashes of genius. As he grew to maturity his talents developed and he was soon the bearer of a reputation which was not confined to his immediate home community. As a youth he assisted his father in perfecting the machinery for the manufacture of the standard wax strings for sealing fruit cans, jars, etc., and the capacity of this machine is now 300,000 daily. Later he turned his attention to the invention of a submarine vessel, for which he made drawings, specifications and a working model. He was then a lad of but twenty years, but had faith in his invention, which he brought before government officials, only to be treated with the indifference that is given a crank or visionary. Returning from the east, where he had met with this setback, he decided that his machine needed further improvements. Later these ideas were incorporated in the models of the submarines built by J. P. Holland, the "Peacemaker" and the "Holland." Next, Mr. Coddington produced a wax-coated paper ring, to take the place of a rubber ring on Mason fruit jars, and this he subsequently sold to Ball Brothers, glass manufacturers, for the sum of $20,000. Another utilitarian article invented by him is the "helping hand," so named by his son, Earl, a device for lifting hot pans or kettles from the stove without injury to the hand. Mr. Coddington also invented the rocker washing machine and a sealing wax machine for sealing fruit cans. This latter moulded the wax cakes, weighed them and threw out the light-weights, removed the cakes from the mold and automatically put the cakes in cartons, in fact doing everything except put them in a shipping case, at the rate of 10,000 per day. This patent he sold at a good figure. Mr. Coddington is also a talented artist in oil colors, is an expert photographer and a skilled wood carver. He is very fond of travel and has visited many of the large cities of interest in this and other countries, where he has indulged his love of art in some of the famous galleries and his penchant for literature in noted libraries. He is a Democrat, but has not cared for public life, his greatest pleasure being found in his beautiful home at West Middletown, which he built several years ago on coming to this community from Middletown. October 13, 1889, Mr. Coddington married Mary F. B., daughter of John and Mary (Saybaugh) Link, and to this union there have been born three children: Myrtle R. A., Earl L. and Inez E. Myrtle, who is living at Los Angeles, Calif., at the home of her aged grandmother, was for five years a teacher at Middletown, two years at Fairfield and one year at Dayton. She is at present engaged in the study of Osteopathy. Earl L., of Middletown, is an expert automobilist and graduate electrician, and the proprietor of the East End Garage. He is known as the third inventive genius in the Coddington family, his time and mind being applied to the invention of a new type of engine, automatic gear shifting and engine starter, all for the improvement of automobiles; in conjunction with these are several other inventions underway. He is also a talented musician and artist. He married Theresa Ankill, of Middletown. Inez E. was a nurse in the Deaconess hospital, Cincinnati, but contemplates taking up the study of Osteopathy as a profession. She has inherited her father's artistic tastes, and has received commendation and honors upon her work in oils. With her parents, she belongs to the Baptist church, while Myrtle belongs to the Presbyterian faith and Earl L. and wife to the United Brethren denomination." <A HREF="../sources.html#1770"><sup>1770</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#1777"><sup>,1777</sup></a></font></p>
