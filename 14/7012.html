Recently discovered in the researches of Franklin P. Cole, it has until now not been published nor, apparently, known to historians. The script has been transcribed by chirographer, Mrs. Ella Budd of Waybridge, Surrey, England, whose expertise has been employed in connection with other documents of these sudies (sic). The signature is not only clear but is, without question, that of Thomas Cushman, the surviving son of Robert, as may be seen by comparing it with that supplied in Wm. S. Russell's engravings of early Colony signatures (Pilgrim Memorials &amp; Guide, Boston, 1855, p. 42). An interesting similarity to that of his father, Robert, is manifest by attention to the latter's written signature preserved in the Deposition of 1624 [Carla's note: Which may be found in a later section entitled More About Robert Cushman, etc.].<br><br>Unfortunately, the date of Thomas Cushman's petition to the Court of Plymouth is not supplied with the document. A clue to its date, however, is its stated reason for being, namely, that, as Thomas declares, the Lord has given him "many children" and that he is loath to contemplate their eventual departure from Plymouth Colony for want of land.<br><br>Of the "many children," the first child of Thomas and Mary Allerton Cushman, according to record, was a son, Thomas junior, born the 16th of September 1637. This obviously accounts for the signature of Thomas Cushman as "senyor." The date of the birth of Thomas Jr. indicates the probable latest date, otherwise unknown, for the marriage of Thomas Cushman and Mary Allerton as some time in December of the year 1636. On this premise, Thomas, at the time of his marriage, would have been thirtyu-one, and Mary, his wife, about twenty-six years of age. If seemingly belated, then to be noted is the fact that Thomas's grandfather, Thomas Couchman of Rolvende, Kent, likewise was at least thirty at the time of his marriage to Eleanor Hubbarde of that parish, 18 July 1568. Likewise, was his father not married until 1606 in his twenty-ninth year. The first child, Thomas Jr., was followed by two daughters in succession, Sarah and Lydia, neither of whose birth dates are supplied in the Cushman Genealogy; and so far as the records show, the fourth child and second son, Isaac, was born February 8, 1647/48. From these things, including the absence of birth dates for the female children of Thomas Cushman's family, it is evident that separatist congregationalism of the Plymouth Church rejected that Canon of the Church of England which, since 1538, had prescribed a recording in parish registers of the date infant baptisms, or others, together with those of all marriages and burials of either parishioners or strangers. Instead, it appears, record keeping of births was transferred at Plymouth to some office of the Magistracy -- as in Leyden, Holland -- and that church records of baptisms had not become operative by mid-seventeenth century in Plymouth Colony or that female birth dates were not recorded, or that records were carelessly handled. Thomas Cushman's petition was grounded in his claim to a gift of "many children" who would need farming land for continuing life in the colony. Likewise, it was implied that the grandchildren of Robert Cushman deserved fair consideration. It is barely possible that four living children might have sufficed for Cushman to speak publicly of "many children" with the birth of the fourth child, Isaac, in 1648. It would be better justified with the birth of the third son, Elkannah, born 1st of June 1651 and, more so, with the birth of Feare, a sixth child and son, born 10th February 1653. But it would indeed be a claim to "many children" to which an exception could hardly be taken with the birth of Eleazer, the seventh child and a son, born 20th February 1656/57. The eighth child was Mary, a daughter, the date of whose birth is not preserved to us. On this ground, we may reasonably surmise that Thomas Cushman's petition to the General Court for farming land for his "many children" was hardly justifiable prior to the birth of Elkannah in 1651, or better, that of Feare in 1653. In the interest of arriving at a probable date for Thomas Cushman's petition to the "Honourable Court" of Plymouth Colony, assembled, two possible dates are about equally plausible. The first is the annual meeting of the Assembly in the year 1651, the second, in the year 1657. They were years when, not Wm. Bradford, but Mr. Thomas Prince was elected to the office of Governor, indeed, by the 5th of June 1657 Wm. Bradford had died. Both years were late enough to justify Cushman's claim of "many children," which would have been hardly a secret. Furthermore, the nature of Cushman's claim for appropriate recognition of his father, Robert Cushman's, central role in the founding of the colony, beginning in 1617, and, thus, the just desert of his grandchildren for land to dwell upon, was on its face reasonable. Yet, had Wm. Bradford been in the chair presiding over the meeting, the appeal of Thomas Cushman to history would have been rather superfluous. Moreover, it might have appeared a bit jarring because, as a public statement, it might, for some, have implied willful neglect. Yet such a supposition of either ignorance or neglect would hardly have been entertained by Thomas Cushman who, from his fourteenth year in December 1621, had been received into the home of Bradford and, as a ward, had been reared in the Governor's household. If, however, we alter the presiding officer and dramatis personnae and envision Thomas Prince as in the chair for meeting of the Assembly in either 1651 or 1657, what is the altered dynamics? While much older than Thomas Cushman, Thomas Prince too had come to New Plymouth on the ship Fortune in 1621 along with Thomas and his father, Robert. Prince, moreover, had not come without interview and agreement with Robert Cushman in London, hence Prince had some experience of Cushman's agency in the migration. But more than thirty years had passed by either 1651 or 1657, and the membership of the Assembly was composed mainly, perhaps entirely, of second generation settlers. By 1657, "the Pilgrim fathers" were all gone. Though some younger contemporaries survived to be sure, none of the "first Beginners" -- to recall the word of Nathaniel Morton -- now remained. This Thomas Cushman knew quite well as he formulated his petition for land to the Assembly. He certainly could not count upon such vivid recollections as would be the case either with Gov. Bradford or Thomas Prince regarding the person and role of his father in the few but immensely important years of the founding process between 1617 and 1625. And finally, if, as Nathaniel Morton tells us, Wm. Bradford had died shortly before the June Assembly of Plymouth freemen, that fact alone could have easily cleared the way, as it also justified, Thomas Cushman's appeal to history before time's passage should further dim the community of recollection and of obligation to a principal founder, long departed, and on behalf of his grandchildren. If, as may well be the case, Thomas Cushman's petition went before the Colony Court in the year 1657 for deliberate consideration, he had already, by action of the Plymouth Church congregation, been Ruling Elder since 1649, or for eight years. Albeit, with proper decorum he adopts in Court the appropriate role of a humble suppliant in his petitioning. This manner and posture, suited to his political status as "freeman," is a clear indication of an acknowledged disjunction between church and state, functionally conceived, on the part of the chief ecclesiastical officer of New Plymouth. With a little reflection, it discloses to the discerning one of the manifest differences between the Plymouth and the Bay and Connecticut colonies from the early seventeenth century onward. Plymouth never drifted in the direction of theocracy unlike its sister colonies. It was fundamentally and from the start the American exemplum of the "free churches" and/or the separation of church and state.<br><br>Thomas arrived at Plymouth in good health, in Nov., 1621. In a few days his father returned to England, leaving his only son in the family of his particular friend, Gov. Bradford. ... If it is true that, "As the twig is bent the tree's inclined," then we have the very best evidence that Gov. Gradford was faithful to the trust imposed in him by his absent friend. In a letter from Gov. B. to Robert Cushman, dated June, 1625, he says, "Your son is in good health (blessed be God). ... I hope God will make him a good man". And such proved to be the case as his history will show.<br><br>3-16-27.<br><br>At a public Court held on the 22d of May, it is considered by the whole company, that the cattle which were the company's, to wit--the cows and the goats--should be equally divided by lot to all persons of the same company. The cattle and goats were, therefore, divided into twelve lots, and thirteen persons appointed to each lot.<br><br>The eleventh lot fell to Gov. Bradford and those with him, among whom was Thomas Cushman, then in the 20th year of his age."To this lot fell an heifer of the last year, which was of the great white back cow that was brought over in the Ann, and two she goats." [Footnote: The first cattle imported from England were "a bull and three heifers," by Edward Winslow, in 1624] Jan. 1, 1633. These following were admitted into the freedom of the society, viz: Mr. William Collins, Thomas Willett, John Cooke and Thomas Cushman. He was then twenty-five or twenty-six years of age.<br><br>July 1, 1634. "At a generall Court holden before the Governor and Councill, Thomas Cushman plantife agaynst John Combe, Gent. defendant, being cast and adjudged to pay the sayd summe of ten pounds to the plaintife or his Assigns at or before the first of Aug. or else to deliver to him a sufficient cow cafe weaned or weanable." [Footnote: Plymouth Colony Records; Court Order 3, vol. 1]<br><br>1635. Thomas Cushman first served as a Juryman.<br><br>1635 or 36 (about). He m. Mary Allerton, the third child of Isaac Allerton, who came over in the Mayflower in 1620. ... In that matrimonial relation they lived together the long period of fifty-five years: she surviving him nearly ten years.<br><br>1637. There was granted "to Thomas Cushman the remaynder of the marsh before the house he liveth in wch Mrs. Fuller doth not use and the little pcell at the wading place on the other side Joanes River." It is supposed that he removed to Jones River (now Kingston, Plymouth Co MA, Plymouth Co MA) about this time, which was not long after he was married, and that there he lived and died.<br><br>1645. He purchased "Prence's farm" at Jones River (now "Rocky Nook" in Kingston, Plymouth Co MA, Plymouth Co MA) by exchanging land at Sowams [Footnote: On Naragansett Bay in Rhode Island] for it, for œ75. It was first owned by his father-in-law, Isaac Allerton. The exact locality of his house is now pointed out, and a spring of water near it has for many years received the cognomen of "the Elder's Spring," from Elder Thomas Cushman, whose house stood near it. It is located in that part of Kingston, Plymouth Co MA, Plymouth Co MA now called "Rocky Nook," about fifty rods northerly from the present traveled highway, on the border of the marsh. A description and the boundaries of the land as given in the early Colony Records, show, beyond a doubt, that the tradition respecting that spring and the location of the Elder's house, must be correct. Men and things have changed in the course of two hundred years: yet the topography of that vicinity remains the same. The "Elder's Spring" is often visited by antiquarians, and by those who have sprung from the stock of the Pilgrims, and who venerate their deeds. The writer of this has drank from that pure spring, where his venerable ancestor allayed his thirst in days of yore; and he hopes he has thus become inspired with something of the Pilgrim's faith, and a fearless determination, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and judgment; and in the strong and emphatic language of another [Footnote: Thomas Jefferson's letter to Dr. Rush, dated at Monticello, Virginia, Sept. 23, 1800], "has sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."<br><br>1649. The office of Ruling Elder of the Church at Plymouth, having become vacant by the death of the venerable Elder Brewster, Thomas Cushman was appointed to that office and continued in it to his death,  a period of over 43 years. He was ordained to that office by appropriate ceremonies and religious services, on Friday the 6th of April, 1649.  In order to show the importance of the office of Ruling Elder, that was held for so long a period by our worthy ancestor, we give, from Prince's Chronology, the following summary of the religious tenets of the Plymothean Fathers, so far as they relate to Church government: "They maintained that every Christian congregation ought to be governed by its own laws, without depending on the jurisdiction of Bishops, or being subject to the authority of Synods, Presbyteries, or any ecclesiastical assembly whatever. They maintained that the inspired scriptures only contain the true religion, and that every man has the right of judging for himself and worshipping according to his apprehension of the meaning of them.  Their officers were Pastors or teaching Elders who have the power of overseeing and teaching, and of administering the sacraments, etc.  32d, Ruling Elders who are to help the Pastor in ruling and overseeing. 33d, Deacons who are to take care of the treasury of the Church; distribute to the needy and minister at the Lord's Table."  We thus see that Thomas Cushman held a highly responsible and important office in the hierarchy of the Plymouth Colony.<br><br>April 4, 1654. Mrs. Sarah Jenny [Footnote: The wife of John Jenny, who came over in the ship Ann, in 1623. He was a member of Rev. Mr. Robinson1s Church at Leyden], by her Will, gave "To Elder Cushman the Bible which was my daughter Susannah's."<br><br>we take the following statement of the duties and character of Elder Thomas Cushman: "About four or five years after Mr. Brewster1s death, (he d. Tuesday, 16 April, 1644), the Church chose Mr. Thomas Cushman as his successor in the office of Ruling Elder, son of that servant of Christ, Mr. Robert Cushman, who had been their chief agent in transacting all their affairs in England, both before and after their leaving of Holland, till the year 1625. And this his son, inheriting the same spirit and being completely qualified, with gifts and graces, proved a great blessing to the Church; assisting Mr. Rayner [Footnote: Pastor of the Church at Plymouth] not only in ruling, catechising and visiting, but also in public teaching, as Mr. Brewster had done before him: it being the professed principle of this Church in their first formation to choose none for governing Elders but such as are able to teach; 1 which abilities (as Mr. Robinson observes in one of his letters) other reformed churches did not require of their Ruling Elders."<br><br>Extract from a Deed of land:<br><br>"Two acres of marsh meadow bee it more or lesse lying before the house and land of the Elder Cushman at Joaneses Riever next unto a pcell of meadow which was Phineas Prats." (Footnote: Plymouth Records.]<br><br>March 29, 1653. Ousamequin (Massasoit) and his oldest son Wamsitto convey by deed a tract of land in Rehoboth to Thomas Prence, Thomas Cushman and others, for which they pay the sum of thirty-five pounds sterling. This is another evidence of the justice of our fathers. They showed their faith by their works. "About the year 1650 to 1660, the Quakers proved very troublesome to the Church and subverted many. The Lord was pleased to bless the endeavors of their faithful Elder, Mr. Cushman, in concurrence with several of the abler brethren, to prevent the efficacy of error and delusion; and (though destitute of a Pastor) the body of the Church were upheld in their integrity and in a constant opposition to their pernicious tenets. And we desire, say the records, that the good providence of God herein may never be forgotten, but that the Lord may have all the praise and glory thereof; for how easily might these wolves in sheep1s clothing have ruined this poor flock of Christ, if the Lord had not interposed by his almighty power and goodness; improving this our good elder as a special instrument in this worthy work, both by teaching the will of God every Lord's day, for a considerable time, plainly, powerfully and profitably; and seconding the same by a blameless life and conversation."<br><br>"After Rev. Mr. Rayner left, the worship of God was carried on by their Elder, Mr. Cushman, assisted by some of the brethren: insomuch that not one Sabbath passed without two public meetings."

On 12 December 1621, during his brief sojourn at Plymouth, Cushman preached a sermon whose principal intent was to convince the Pilgrims to accept the terms offerred by the London merchants, and was therefore more of an economic than a theological nature.

St. Peter's, Leiden, 11 March 1616 [NS] [ Dexter 611; Small Gen 688].<br><br>      iii   Child, bur. St. Peter's, Leiden, 24 October 1616 [NS] [ Dexter 611; Small Gen 688].<br><br>   <br><br>COMMENTS: Beginning in 1617, and continuing right up until the time of his death, Robert Cushman spent much time in London and vicinity negotiating on behalf of the Leiden congregation and later on behalf also of the settlers in Plymouth. He, JOHN CARVER and WILLIAM BREWSTER labored constantly in their dealings with a number of London merchants, arranging for the shipping and provisions for the Mayflower and the Speedwell in 1620. The details of these negotiations constitute a large portion of the story told by Bradford in his history of these years.<br>   Cushman had planned to make the voyage across the Atlantic in 1620, but when the Speedwell had to be abandoned he was one of those who remained behind [ Bradford 54]. This original intention of Cushman's and his many other services in behalf of the Pilgrims are undoubtedly the justification for the assignment to Cushman in 1623 of land in Plymouth as if he had been a passenger on the Mayflower .<br>   On 2 November 1636 "William Hodgekins &amp; Sara Cushman" were married at Plymouth [ PCR 1:45]. Some have held that this was another child of Robert Cushman, but this remains only a surmise [see Small Gen 688-93].<br>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE: Lora Underhill has gathered together every record known to her of the life of Robert Cushman, and in the process has compiled the best biography available of the man. Her treatment also goes into great detail on the career of his son Thomas [ Small Gen 669-755, with Robert Cushman at 669-93]. Elizabeth French in 1914 published her research into the ancestry of Robert Cushman, including extensive transcripts of records of the family in Kent [ NEHGR 68:181-85]. <A HREF="../sources.html#274"><sup>274</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#709"><sup>,709</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3856"><sup>,3856</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3857"><sup>,3857</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3858"><sup>,3858</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3859"><sup>,3859</sup></a></font></p>
