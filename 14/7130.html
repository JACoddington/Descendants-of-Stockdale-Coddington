<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Isaac Allerton, Sr., born in England, was among the storied Pilgrims who came to Plymouth, Massachusetts, aboard the Mayflower in December [sic] 1620. He is said to have been the wealthiest of the group and the most worldly, as well one of the best educated and least dogmatic in his religious views. <br>Isaac was accompanied on the voyage by his three children and pregnant first wife, Mary, whose child died stillborn on the ship, anchored in the harbor. The hardships of the terrible first winter brought death to nearly half the Pilgrims, including the weakened Mary. A few years later, Isaac married Fear Brewster, daughter of William Brewster, the Pilgrims' Elder (effective pastor). She had joined her parents at Plymouth in 1623. Isaac served as assistant governor for several years and journeyed back to England in behalf of Plymouth Colony three times. The colony's existence depended greatly upon his successful negotiations. Additionally, he is credited with founding the coastal trade and local fishing industry. <br>His liberal religious views, however, brought him into increasing conflict with Governor Bradford. A year or two after Fear died in 1634, he moved his trading activities to New Amsterdam, where he remained ten years before retiring to New Haven, Connecticut, with his third wife. When he died in 1659, his son, Isaac Jr., a Harvard graduate who had participated in his father's business ventures, soon became a widower himself and migrated to a new life in Virginia.  (C. Acree).<br><br>Underhill, Lora A. W.. 1910. Descendants of Edward Small of New England and the Allied Families, with tracings of English Ancestry, vol. 2: 756-851 contains an extensive biography of Isaac Allerton. Mayflower passenger.<br><br>Isaac Allerton was born in England about 1583-1586, but his parentage has not been identified. He may be related to Mayflower passenger John Allerton &lt;http://members.aol.com/calebj/jallerton.html>, but no relationship between them has been documented. Isaac Allerton is found in several Leyden records, and his sister Sarah married Degory Priest there on the same day as Isaac's marriage to Mary Norris. A John Allerton and a Robert Allerton can also be found in Leyden records. <br>On 18 June 1618 in Leyden, Isaac Allerton, tailor, made a sworn statement for Nicholas Claverly, witnessed by Degory Priest &lt;http://members.aol.com/calebj/degory.html>. On 9 January 1619, Isaac Allerton made agreement with Alice Gallant, widow of John Hooke and current wife of Henry Gallant, to apprentice her twelve-year old son John Hooke to Isaac Allerton, to learn the tailor trade. John Hooke &lt;http://members.aol.com/calebj/hooke.html> came with Isaac on the Mayflower, but died the first winter. <br><br>Mayflower Compact 1620 <br>Agreement Between the Settlers at New Plymouth : 1620<br>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN.

Isaac Allerton and his wife were assigned pews in New Haven meeting house, 10 March 1646/7 [ Small Gen 815]. (The Salem record may refer to a different man, as the records come so close together, and Allerton had not lived at Marblehead for some time.)<br>FREEMAN: In "1633" Plymouth list of freemen, immediately after Councillors, and well before those admitted on 1 January 1632/3 [ PCR 1:3]; in Plymouth list of 7 March 1636/7 [ PCR 1:52].<br>EDUCATION: Although there is no direct evidence of Isaac Allerton's education, and nothing written in his own hand, he must have been well-educated to engage in business, political and diplomatic activities as extensively as he did.<br>OFFICES: In early 1621, after the death of John Carver, William Bradford was chosen Governor, and "Isaac Allerton was chosen to be an assistant unto him who, by renewed election every year, continued sundry years together" [ Bradford 86]. Chosen Assistant, 1 January 1633/4 [ PCR 1:21].<br>ESTATE: In the 1623 Plymouth land division "Mr. Isaak Alerton" received seven acres [ PCR 12:4; MQ 40:10]. In the 1627 Plymouth cattle division Mr. Isaac Allerton, his wife Feare Allerton, Bartholomew Allerton, Remember Allerton, Mary Allerton and Sarah Allerton were the first six persons in the second company [ PCR 12:9].<br>   Assessed £3 11s. in Plymouth tax list of 25 March 1633 and £1 16s. in list of 27 March 1634 [ PCR 1:9, 27].<br>   Assigned mowing ground for year, 1 July 1633 [ PCR 1:14].<br>   On 6 May 1635 the Massachusetts Bay General Court noted that "Mr. Ollerton hath given to Moses Maveracke, his son-in-law, all his houses, buildings, &amp; stages, that he hath at Marble Head, to enjoy to him &amp; his heirs forever" [ MBCR 1:147].<br>   On 27 October 1646 "Isacke Allerton" of New Amsterdam in the province of New Netherlands, merchant, confirmed to son-in-law Thomas Cushman of New Plymouth a debt of one hundred pounds owed to Isaac by John Coombe [ PCR 2:133].<br>   In his "will," undated and proved 19 October 1659, "Isaac Alerton, late of New Haven, deceased," devoted most of the space to a list of debts owing to him, and then ordered "my son Isaac Allerton and my wife, as trustees to receive in my debts, &amp; to pay what I owe, as far as it will go &amp; what is overplus I leave to my wife and my son Isaac, as far as they receive the debts to pay what I owe." The inventory, taken 12 February 1658/9, totalled £118 5s. 2d., and included "the dwelling house, orchard &amp; barn with two acres of meadow," £75 [ MD 2:155-57; Small Gen 818-24].<br>BIRTH: About 1586 (deposed 26 September 1639 aged about 53 [ Lechford 189-90; MD 4:109-10]).<br>DEATH: New Haven between 1 February 1658/9 (court appearance) and 12 February 1658/9 (date of inventory).<br>MARRIAGE: (1) At Leiden 4 November 1611 [New Style] Mary Norris "single woman from Newbury in England" [ MD 7:129-30]; died Plymouth 25 February 1620/1 [ Prince 289].<br>   (2) At Plymouth between 1623 and 1627 Fear Brewster, daughter of WILLIAM BREWSTER ; she died not long before 12 December 1634, presumably at Plymouth [ MD 30:97-98; WP 3:177].<br>   (3) By 1644 Joanna Swinnerton, probably the "Mrs. Swinnerton" who received a grant of land at New Haven on 17 March 1640/1 [ NHCR 1:50; NEHGR 124:133; MD 42:124].<br>CHILDREN:<br><tab>   With first wife<br><br><tab>   i   BARTHOLOMEW, b. say 1613; he returned to England, became minister at "Bamfield," Suffolk; m.

(2) Virginia about 1663 Elizabeth (Willoughby) (Overzee) Colclough, dau. of Capt. Thomas Willoughby and widow of Simon Overzee and George Colclough [Wakefield, Isaac Allerton of the Mayflower... (Plymouth 1990) 4-5]; all modern authorities agree that the Isaac Allerton born at New Haven in 1655, son of this Isaac Allerton by his first wife, died without issue, and some other origin must be found for the Allertons who appear in New Haven late in the seventeenth century [ MQ 45:23; MD 42:117].<br><br>ASSOCIATIONS: Brother of Sarah Allerton, wife successively of John Vincent, DEGORY PRIEST and GODBERT GODBERTSON . On 2 December 1633, as part of the settlement of the estate of Godbert Godbertson, it was noted that "the greater part of his debts are owing to Mr. Isaack Allerton, of Plym., merchant, late brother of the said Zarah" [ PCR 1:20].<br>COMMENTS: In his list of Mayflower passengers Bradford included "Mr. Isaac Allerton and Mary his wife, with three children, Bartholomew, Remember and Mary. And a servant boy John Hooke" [ Bradford 441]. In his 1651 accounting of these families, he reported that "Mr. Allerton his wife died with the first, and his servant John Hooke. His son Bartle is married in England but I know not how many children he hath. His daughter Remember is married at Salem and hath three or four children living. And his daughter Mary is married here and hath four children. Himself married again with the daughter of Mr. Brewster and hath one son living by her, but she is long since dead. And he is married again and hath left this place long ago. So I account his increase to be eight, besides his son's in England" [ Bradford 444-45].<br>   Isaac Allerton was one of the busiest and most complicated men in early New England, and no attempt is made here to cover his career comprehensively. A full-scale biography would be needed for that, and an outline of what is available is given in the next section below. Records for Allerton may be found in virtually every colony on the Atlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean, including Newfoundland, New Netherland, New Sweden, Virginia, Barbadoes, and Curacao.<br>   Although some records of Allerton in New Netherland describe him as "of Suffolk," it is not certain that this refers to his place of origin in England, as some have claimed.<br>   In noting his various residences above, we do not estimate years of removal, as he seems to have maintained residences simultaneously at more than one location. Also, the attempt made above to describe the estate of Allerton does not come close to showing the magnitude and intricacy of his business activities. No one has yet tried to survey comprehensively this, the major part of Allerton's life.<br>   Since Moses Maverick, the husband of Remember Allerton, received Isaac Allerton's estate at Marblehead, and Isaac Jr. received his father's estate at New Haven, it is likely that Thomas and Mary (Allerton) Cushman were at some time given Allerton's property at Plymouth (assuming that there was more at Plymouth than the debt assigned by Allerton to Cushman in 1646 [ PCR 2:133]).<br>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE: The descendants of Isaac Allerton were treated extensively by Walter S. Allerton about a century ago, but this account is now obsolete [ A History of the Allerton Family in the United States, 1585 to 1885... (New York 1888, rev. 1900)].<br>   More recently Lora Underhill published an extremely detailed account of Isaac Allerton and his children [ Small Gen 756-851]. Although this version of the life of Isaac Allerton has been shown to have errors, and although many new discoveries have been made, it has great value because it attempts to cite every record in which Allerton ever appeared (as available in 1934), and prints many of the records in full.<br>   Much of the modern research on Allerton has been carried out by Newman Hall, presented in a series of periodical articles [ NEHGR 124:133; MQ 45:23-24, 47:14-18; Virginia Genealogist 32:83-92, 171-78, 287-96; MD 40:7-10]. More recently Robert S. Wakefield has prepared the four-generation "genealogy in progress" published by the General Society of Mayflower Descendants [ Isaac Allerton of the Mayflower... (Plymouth 1990)].<br>   For a different interpretation of the character of Isaac Allerton, see Michael McGiffert, "Religion and Profit Do Jump Together: The First American Pilgrim," Reflections 87:15-23 (a publication of Yale Divinity School). <A HREF="../sources.html#3253"><sup>3253</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3859"><sup>,3859</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3960"><sup>,3960</sup></a></font></p>
