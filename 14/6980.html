<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Notes of Henry Wyles Cushman: Elkanah is distinguished in history as one of the seven persons who founded the "Old Colony Club," in 1769, which was the first organized commemoration of the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, in 1620; and from which has proceeded the present "Pilgrim Society" at Plymouth, which was formed in 1820, the two hundredth anniversary of that event.<br><br>As the formation of the "Old Colony Club" is quite a noted circumstance in the history of that day, and as Elkanah was an officer (Steward) in that Association, we give a sketch of its organization, copied from its records, which are yet extant:<br><br>"January 16th, 1769. We whose names are underwritten, having maturely weighed and seriously considered the many disadvantages and inconveniences that arise from intermixing with the company at the taverns in this town, and apprehending that a well regulated Club will have a tendency to prevent the same, and to increase not only the pleasure and happiness of the respective members, but also will conduce to their edification and instruction, do hereby incorporate ourselves into a Society by the name of the OLD COLONY CLUB.  For the better regulation of which we do covenant and agree to observe all such rules and laws as shall from time to time be made by the Club. Dated at our Hall in Plymouth the day and year above written.<br><br>Isaac Lothrop, Pelham Winslow, Thomas Lothrop, John Thomas, Edward Winslow, Jr., John Watson, Elkanah Cushman."<br><br>The officers of the Club were Isaac Lothrop, Esq., President; Thomas Lothrop, Esq., Secretary; and Elkanah Cushman, Steward.<br><br>Old Colony Day. First celebration of the landing of our Forefathers, -- Friday, Dec. 22, 1769. In the morning a cannon was fired, and an elegant silk flag, with this inscription, OLD COLONY, was raised upon the Hall. At half-past 2 o'clock, the members dine together. As Elkanah Cushman was the Steward, and as the bill of fare was unique and original, we give a copy of it:<br><br>"1, a large baked whortleberry pudding; 2, a dish of sauquetach [succotash]; 3, a dish of clams; 4, a dish of oysters and a dish of cod-fish; 5, a haunch of venison roasted by the first jack brought to this country; 6, a dish of sea fowl; 7, a dish of frost fish and eels; 8, an applie pie; 9, a course of cranberry tarts and cheese made in the Old Colony.<br><br>These articles were dressed in the plainest manner, (all appearance of luxury and extravagance being avoided, in imitation of our ancestors, whose memory we shall ever respect.)<br><br>At 4 o'clock P. M. the members of our Club, headed by the Steward, carrying a folio volume of the Laws of the Old Colony, hand in hand, marched in procession to the Hall."<br><br>* * *  The evening was spent in an agreeable manner, with conversation, toasts and speeches. The sixth regular toast was as follows:<br><br>To the memory of Mr. Robert Cushman, who preached the first Sermon in New England."<br><br>The Old Colony Club continued to celebrate the anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims till 1773, when it was dissolved in consequence of conflicting opinions existing among its members in relation to the American Revolution; some portion of them being attached to the Royal interest. It is probable that Elkanah Cushman belonged to the latter class, from the following notice of him in "Sabine's American Loyalists," p. 238:<br><br>"Cushman, Elkanah, -- a petty officer in the customs. In 1776 he embarked at Boston for Halifax, with the British army." In 1769 he "made a survey of a shorter route from Plymouth to the metropolis, through Weymouth and Abington, a work of utility and worthy of remembrance."<br><br>Elkanah Cushman was a loyalist during the American Revolution.<br><br>[Footnote: Mass. Hist. Coll. 2d s., v. 3, p. 176.]<br><br>Nothing further is known of him or of the time or place of his death. He had only one son, by Mary Lothrop.<br><br>He did not marry Mary LOTHROP.<br><br>Acc. to HWC, she bore Elkanah his only child, a son--Elkanah. <A HREF="../sources.html#3482"><sup>3482</sup></a></font></p>
