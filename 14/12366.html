<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Ancestor of Presidents George H. W. and George W. Bush (11th Great grandfather).<br>"The following is taken from Hamlin Family Genealogy, pg. 87.<br>"Mr. THOMAS HUCKINS,1 b. 1617; m. 1st, 1642, Mary, dau. of Isaac Wells, of Barnstable; who was buried July 28, 1648; m. 2d, Nov. 3, 1648, Rose, widow of Hugh Hyllier of Yarmouth. Mass. Little is known of his early history; he came over before 21 years of age and resided in the vicinity of Boston; member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company and bore its standard, 1639. The name was written Huckins, Hutckins, Huckens and Huggins, the latter being the early pronunciation. Several of the name came early to Mass. A Mr. Thomas Hutchins was assistant to the Governor of the Mass. Bay Company, in England, and promoter of the company; which may account for the early settlement of those of this name in Mass.; and for the prominence of the subject of this sketch. He removed to Barnstable, and was presumably one of Mr. Collicut's Company; a superior business man, wealthy, and was one of the partners who hired the Cape Cod fisheries; constable, 1646; selectman many years; deputy, 1669-78; member of council of war, 1671; Commissary General, 1675; and held other offices of trust and honor; licensed to keep the ordinary and sell wine, 1652-3. He was a member of Mr. Lothrop's church; of which Otis remarks: "No patent of nobility granted to an ancestor, can confer so much honor on a man as to be able to trace his descent from a member of Mr. Robinson or Mr. Lothrop's church." To his everlasting credit be it said, that he was of the tolerant element of that church. He was a large land owner; and captain of the packet. He and his son Joseph were cast away in his vessel and perished in a gale. Nov. 9, 1679. His widow d. 1687, aged about 71 years." <A HREF="../sources.html#3474"><sup>3474</sup></a></font></p>
