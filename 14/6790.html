<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"The Ayres Clinic was founded in 1976 by A. Jean Ayres, PhD, OTR, an occupational therapist and licensed clinical psychologist who was a pioneer in the field of learning disabilities. The Ayres Clinic was her private practice where she evaluated and treated children, taught USC graduate students in occupational and physical therapy, and treatment of sensory integrative disorders.<br><br>The A. Jean Ayres Memorial Library, which was the personal and professional collection of the late Dr. Ayres is located at the Clinic. The clinic also houses a library with literature from the fields of neuropsychology, neurophysiology, medicine, rehabilitation, occupational and physical therapy. These resources are important for the research and clinical activities that take place at The Ayres Clinic"<br><br>"What is Sensory Integration? Sensory Integration is the organization of sensation for use so that we can respond. Sensory Integration theory is based on the work of Dr Jean A. Ayres. It is based on the premise that the primary building blocks of the central nervous system are the senses, particularly the special senses - vestibular, tactile, and proprioception. All other skills are complex processes based on a strong foundation of sensory integration. To put simply sensory integration is the ability to take in, sort out , and connect information from the world around us in an organized manner."<br><br>"The History of A. Jean Ayers [sic] and Sensory Integration<br>A. Jean Ayres, PhD,OTR,FAOTA,is credited with having first identified sensory integrative dysfunction. She is the author of the Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests, and was one of occupational therapy's foremost leaders in theory development. Born in 1920, Anna Jean Ayres grew up on a farm in Visalia, California. As a child, she struggled with learning problems similar to those she would later study. After obtaining a master's degree in occupational therapy and a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Southern California, Dr. Ayres began postdoctoral work at UCLA's Brain Research Institute. Here she began to formulate her theory of sensory integrative dysfunction. Prior to Dr. Ayres' landmark research, children who had sensory integrative dysfunction suffered from a misunderstood disability. Parents were frustrated by a child who would become agitated by simple daily tasks, had more labored handwriting than other children, had difficulty attending in school and was disorganized at home. Through her research, Dr. Ayres made the discovery that such children had a neural disorder that resulted in inefficient organization of sensory input received by the nervous system. She developed diagnostic tools for identifying the disorder and proposed a therapeutic approach that transformed pediatric occupational therapy. In 1972, Sensory Integration International, a not-for-profit organization, was established to further Dr. Ayres' work. Through the educational programs offered as part of the mission of Sensory Integration International, and through operation of The Ayres Clinic, the pioneering work of Dr. Ayres Continues."<br><br>"The A. Jean Ayres Award <br>1. Purpose: <br>To recognize annually occupational therapy clinicians, educators, and researchers who have demonstrated sustained commitment to the application, development, or testing of theory in occupational therapy. The award is given in honor of A. Jean Ayres, PhD, OTR, whose concentration on developing theory in support of practice was of great significance to the profession of occupational therapy" <A HREF="../sources.html#3548"><sup>3548</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3549"><sup>,3549</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3550"><sup>,3550</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3551"><sup>,3551</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#3552"><sup>,3552</sup></a></font></p>
