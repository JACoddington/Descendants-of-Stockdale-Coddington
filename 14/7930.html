<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Irene Delroy was born Josephine S. Sanders 21 July 1900 Bloomington, McLean County, Illinois the daughter of Royal W. Sanders and Della Soverns. The name Delroy came from the first name of her parents. "Del" from Della and "roy" from Royal. Her mother Della Soverns was the daughter of Florinda Johnson and Oscar Soverns who were married 6 Sep 1866 in DeWitt Co., IL.<br><br>Top Speed Original, Musical, Comedy Performer: Irene Delroy [Virginia Rollins] Dec 25, 1929 - Mar 22, 1930<br>Follow Thru Original, Musical Performer: Irene Delroy [Lora Moore] Jan 9, 1929 - Dec 21, 1929<br>Here's Howe Original, Musical, Comedy Performer: Irene Delroy [Joyce Baxter] May 1, 1928 - Jul 1928<br>Ziegfeld Follies of 1927 Original, Musical, Revue Performer: Irene Delroy Aug 16, 1927 - Jan 7, 1928<br>The Greenwich Village Follies [1925] Original, Musical, Revue Performer: Irene Delroy Dec 24, 1925 - May 1926<br>Round the Town riginal, Musical, Revue Performer: Irene Delroy May 21, 1924 - May 31, 1924<br>Vogues of 1924 Original, Musical, Revue Performer: Irene Delroy Mar 27, 1924 - Jun 1924<br>The Greenwich Village Follies 1923 Original, Musical, Revue Performer: Irene Delroy Sep 20, 1923 - Jan 1924<br>Frivolities of 1920 Original, Musical, Revue Performer: Irene Delroy<br><br>From All Movie Guide: One of Broadway's brightest, brunette Irene Delroy was completely wasted by the new audible motion picture industry in 1930. The star of the 1927 edition of the Ziegfeld Follies, Delroy headlined Warner Bros.' Oh! Sailor Behave (1930) as a social climber falling in love with a newspaperman in romantic Venice. Unfortunately, leading man Charles King (of Broadway Melody fame), had outstayed his welcome by 1930 and Delroy herself suffered in comparison with her Broadway counterpart in the role, Claudette Colbert. As a result, Oh! Sailor Behave proved Warner Bros.' least popular musical of the season. The Life of the Party (1930), which teamed her with another Broadway refugee, singer/songwriter Jack Whiting, was slightly better but belonged wholeheartedly to the irrepressible Winnie Lightner, with Delroy merely functioning as window dressing. Warners, however, refused to give up, ushering Delroy and Whiting into Men of the Sky (1931), an unlikely musical concoction set in World War I. Along the way, unfortunately, most of Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach's score was scuttled and Men of the Sky proved Delroy's third disappointment in a row. It was to prove her final screen appearance. ~ Hans J. Wollstein, All Movie Guide<br>Daily Pantagraph, Bloomington, IL., Saturday Morning, December 11, 1926 Page Two B<br>IRENE DELROY IS INTERVIEWED<br>Reporter Visits Backstage at Apollo Theatre Chicago During "Greenwich Village Follies ___ By Gervaise Butler<br>If Bloomington was an orchard city instead of an evergreen one, it would be easy to say that it grew one of peachiest peaches in American musical comedy, but since it isn't, all that's necessary is to say that Bloomington is where Irene Delroy is from. Now the casual stroller, or the man on pleasure bent, who walked past the Apollo theater in Chicago last week, invariably stopped before the large photograph of a very pretty girl in an abbreviated black dress, a girl with gloriously blue, deep fringed magnetic eyes, Irene Delroy, the ingenue of the Greenwich Village Follies in its seventh edition. Of course he might not know that she was from Bloomington, but after he got inside his program told him so, and also told him that she had previously been starred in "Hitchy Koo: and an earlier edition of the Greenwich Follies. Here is an actress who actually admits that she was born further west than Brooklyn.<br>Now of course, all that preamble is illuminating, but the fact of the matter is that a friend met me in Chicago one day and said, "Why don't you interview Irene Delroy? She's from Bloomington, only she used to be Joey Sanders down there and she's a darn nice girl." I have only to hear to be curious and perhaps that is the reason that after the exchange of a few wires, I appeared, somewhat "yokel" -- of demeanor, at the stage entrance of the Apollo at matinee time. A fierce old Triton guarded the door, but upon my producing the signed wire and asking in a very throaty whisper if I might see Miss Delroy, her maid said she would see and she came out presently to usher me and a friend I had taken along, into the dressing room. She asked for our coats and before I thought I handed her mine, only to remember that it had in one pocket a large package all wrapped up in a quart bottle. I told her I thought I had better take the coat back again, but she smiled rather archly and told me in a slurred southern accent that it would be perfectly safe. She meant the package<br>After a brief wait, we were ushered in from the outer room to the dressing room proper and there, surrounded by makeup and against a background of luscious silver, green and red gowns, sat Irene Delroy in a very straight sort of "makeup" smock, with her long hair (get that last remark -- long hair)about her shoulders and her fingers busy creating shadows above those same wonderful blue eyes. Then another thing, there is a dimple, just one, but what a dimple, on the right cheek. Very simply, very comfortably, she welcomed us and introductions over, we settled down to talk. What did we talk about? Anything and everything. What a frost the Philadelphia exposition turned out to be. How we should all like to live on Long Island and commute into New York. How dirty, but how lovable Chicago was and how it had changed.<br>Success hasn't turned Irene Delroy's head and what a chance it has had. A product of the Adolf Bohm Ballet at the opera, a girl with a good voice, a beautiful face, a lovely figure and a winning personality that puts her over at every performance and she's just plain "folks." Naturally, the talk did veer to where the show was going to play next week, as it left Chicago Saturday. First there will be a week in Cleveland, than a return week in Milwaukee. Following this, there will be a vacation week which Miss Delroy will occupy in Chicago with just a short visit to Bloomington. She's going to put in her vacation having her teeth, which looked more than perfect, fixed. It's part of the game. Then on Christmas night, the show opens in St. Louis, after which its schedule has not been made out. If the show has the regular run, the season will end in May and then Miss Delroy may go into vaudeville for six weeks as she did last summer.<br>With the call "fifteen minutes" from the call boy, which meant the curtain went up in that time, we began our good byes, meeting on the way out Mrs. Sanders, who is traveling with her daughter and then made our way to the theater auditorium, where we sat enthralled while scene after scene, "Black Bottom," "Slave Boat," and "Cinderella: among them, flashed across the stage. It would be too much to tell about the show, but it was a whizz and Irene Delroy was one of the main reasons why it went over big.<br>----------------------------------------<br>Daily Pantagraph, Bloomington, IL., Sunday, February 13, 1949, Page 18<br>DELROY HIT IN MUSICALS<br>CALLED MOST PHOTOGRAPHED U.

She attended Bloomington High school for two years and then transferred to University high at Normal.<br>In the meantime, she continued to practice and danced at entertainments and recitals while awaiting her "big chance." Finally she was given an opportunity to try out for a part in the ballet of the Chicago Grand Opera company.<br>The 17 year old Bloomingtonian made her debut with the Chicago Grand Opera company at the time Galli Curci and Mary Garden were prominent and chose her stage name, "Irene Delroy." The Delroy was formed by combining the first syllables of the Christian names of her mother and father, Della and Royal.<br>In "Follies."<br>Her father was none too pleased at his daughter's success - - he felt she should continue her education before taking up a career. She disagreed. Finally a compromise was achieved, and Irene agreed that after a year on the stage she would return to school. However, that year was sufficient to take her to New York and the leading part in a musical comedy. Father didn't argue anymore The dimpled Miss Delroy was the heroine in Raymond Hitchcock's "Hitchy Koo in 1923" and signed a four year contract to appear in the <br>"Greenwich Village Follies." Five years of musical comedy work kept her name almost constantly on the theatrical pages of U. S. newspapers.<br>"Ziegfeld Follies" and "Here's How" followed.<br>More than one editor called her the most photographed young woman in the United States and one of the loveliest girls on the stage.

"See Naples and Die" and "Men of the Sky."<br>Sound movies were then relatively new and Irene signed a contract to appear in several . She said she was eager for the new experience. In the meantime, she was gaining more friends, playing golf, attending ball games, and reading. One interviewer pronounced her "amazing.? She says she has read all of H. G. Wells, much of Freud and most of George H. Dorsey. She likes Louis Bromfield's writings and confesses a great admiration for Emil Ludwig and Feuchtwanger. She can drive like Barney Oldfield, dance for hours on end, and then discuss with relish the latest political situation or novel."<br>When the interviewer asked her views' on domesticity, the tiny miss replied, "Domesticity? I'm in favor of it" Apparently she was, for in July 1931 after spending several months in Bloomington remodeling and improving the old Sanders home she married to William Austin, a New York realtor. Along with the announcement of her marriage came her announcement of retirement from the stage and screen. Apparently she meant that too, for only once after her marriage did she return to the stage. That was in 1935 when she played the lead in "Anything Goes."<br>Her marriage ended in divorce in 1937 but she continued living in retirement in New York. She returned to Bloomington for a few days when her grandmother, Mrs. Sue Sanders, died several years ago. The old Sanders home has been sold<br>and the ties between Bloomington and Irene Delroy have been definitely severed.<br>----------------------------------<br>Daily Pantagraph, Bloomington, IL.,<br>Sunday, June 5, 1932, Page 3<br>FORMER IRENE DELROY IN BUSINESS CAREER<br>Miss Irene Delroy's career has shifted from musical comedy and motion picture stardom in business since her marriage last year to William L. Austin, Jr. New York realtor, one learns from her father, Royal S. Sanders, who is visiting his brother, H. P. Sanders, 321 East Chestnut Street. The setting is the Atlantic Beach club on Long Island, and the role is that of hostess and "overseer." This large resort, a favorite of Mayor Walker of New York, and a neighboring club, the Cass del Mar, are owned by Mr. Austin. The Atlantic Beach club opened May 27, and as soon as it is established for the season, Mr. and Mrs. Austin may come to Illinois for a short visit, the latter as written her father. Mrs. Austin spent her girlhood in Bloomington as Josephine Sanders, and as Irene Delroy won recognition as a musical comedy star and motion picture actress. Her mother, Mrs. Sanders, arrived from Chicago, Saturday to visit in Bloomington.<br>-------------------------------------------<br>DAILY PANTAGRAPH, SUNDAY, JULY 4, 1937, PAGE 3<br>IRENE DELROY GETS DIVORCE IN RENO<br>(SMEARED UNREADABLE BEGINNING) Josephine Sanders, professionally known as Irene Delroy, was granted a decree of divorce from her husband, William L.
