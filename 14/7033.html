<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">He was called to the pastorate of the Church in Middleboro, and of the new church established in Plympton... He was more liberal in religious matters than his contemporaries, and secured the adoption of new articles of faith, which have remained to the present day, with little change as the creed of the Congrational Church." (Burt, p. 77) He m. Rebecca Harlow abt. 1675; they had 7 children.<br><br>(Isaac) was a member of the church at Plymouth, and obtained a better education than most men of that day. In 1685 he was one of the Selectmen of Plymouth, and in June 1690 he and John Bradford were the Deputies from Plymouth to the General Court of the Plymouth Colony, and in Aug. the same year another General Court was held and the same Deputies were reelected.<br><br><br><br>In June 1691, John Bradford and Isaac Cushman were again elected Deputies to the General Court, from Plymouth, and it was the last one previous to the union of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Colonies, which took place in 1692. The first General Court of the new Province was held 8 June 1692. His venerable father, Elder Thomas Cushman, having d. in 1691, the church at Plymouth was without a "Ruling Elder," then an office of great importance and responsibility. We may reasonably suppose that the early attention and thoughts of the church were directed to the consideration of a successor; but we find no evidence of any church action till 1694. We copy from the first volume of the Plymouth church Records, p. 22:<br><br><br><br>"1694, March 7, was a church meeting which the Sabbath before the church had notice and were then desired to prepare their thoughts to nominate some brethren to serve in the office of Elders and Deacons. The church spoke man by man, and all but two or three of the brethren nominated Deacon Faunce and Bro. Isaac Cushman for Elders."<br><br><br><br>"1695, June 16: the matter of Elders being named and then nominated, desired to give their answers; Bro. Faunce declined a present acceptance of the call from sense of his own unfitness. Bro. Isaac Cushman desired further time of consideration; in which time our brethren engaged in promoting a new society in our western precincts, gave Bro. Cushman an earnest call to teach the word of God to them, and desired our church to consent thereto. Also in this time Mr. Samuel Fuller, the Teacher of the church at Middlebury, a sincere Godly man whom we had the last yeare dismissed to that service, died August 29th: being about 66 years old, a great losse to that place, immediately upon which that church and Towne sent letters to our church to desire our consent that Bro. Isaac Cushman might be their Teacher, upon all which accounts the church was called to meet on September 1: which they did, and the Pastor acquainted them with those calls our brother had. The church manifested generally their good respect to him and desires not to part with him, but that he should be an Elder here in his blessed Father's room, and desired did: That the Providence of God was mysterious, but he apprehended he should rather accept the call of his church to be Elder here, because it was first given before the other two calls; the church acted no further in that matter at that time, only voted that it would be noe offence but acceptable to them if Bro. Cushman did improve his gifts in teaching at Middlebury or any other place where the orderly providence of God should call him. God soe disposed that he harkened to the call of our Brethren and neighbours of the new society where he now lives and constantly attends the work of Preaching amonst them and is well accepted and acknowledged by them."  Such is the record history of his election as Elder of the Plymouth church, his call to the ministry of the church in Middleboro, and also as Pastor of the new church then established in Plympton, the western Precinct of Plymouth. Which should be accepted, was, indeed, a difficult question to decide. A controversy ensued of more or less warmth, which, as the sequel will show was amicably settled. Isaac, having attained the age of about forty-five years, and under the direction and example of his venerable father, Elder Cushman, having been taught the dogmas and the precepts of the Pilgrims, and having "walked in all the ways of his fathers," and withal being a man of strong intellectual powers and devotional feelings, with benevolence and veneration fully developed in his organization, he resolved to enter the ministry, for which he undoubtedly had pecular "gifts and graces." As a member of the church and as a Deacon, which office he had held several years, he had, undoubtedly, led in their prayers, had exhorted in their conference meetings, and was thus well prepared to become a Pastor. But here a difficulty occurred. The Pilgrims were particular in the smaller matters of the law as well as the more important. He had not served as a Ruling Elder; and the question arose among the Rabbis of the Colony, --Can a man, according to the rules of the Church and the precepts of the Saviour, be ordained as a Pastor, who has not been ordained and served as Ruling Elder? That was a knotty question, indeed, --especially so at that time, when the Pilgrims who had argued with the hierarchy in England and against Arminianism in Holland, had now all passed away.<br><br><br><br>The Rev. Mr. Cotton, Pastor of the Plymouth church, and a minority of that church took the negative side of that question; while Isaac Cushman and a majority of the church took an opposite view of it. Meeting after meeting was held to discuss that great question. The excitement increased. Mr. Cotton felt that the power and influence, as well as the usefulness of the clergy, were at stake. Even the ministers of the Pilgrim church were not entirely destitute of a love of domination, --especially when they felt that they were right. On the other hand, Mr. Cushman and a major part of the church argued that the majority should rule, and that it was a long settled principle of the Congregational body of believers, that each church was entirely independent in its organization from all others. The question waxed hotter, each side claiming that they were following in the footsteps of their predecessors, the English Puritans.<br><br>In the mean time Mr. Cushman commenced preaching at Plympton to a branch of the Plymouth church, without being ordained. That increased the flame, and contention was, for a time, the order of the day in the Plymouth church. Says Dr. Thatcher, "the controversy continued about three years, with considerable warmth and occasioned the withdrawal of some of the members of the church. Many ill reports were propogated, injurious to the reputation and feelings of Mr. Cotton."<br><br>At length it became apparent that Mr. Cushman, his friends and his side of the question must prevail; for he would preach and the people at Plympton would hear him -- ordained or not. And on every principle of the Congregational church were they not right? Thereupon Mr. Cotton asked for a dismissal, which was granted him; and with his departure, the minority abandoned all opposition to Mr. Cushman's ordination; and peace and harmony were again restored to the Plymouth Church.<br><br>The following from the Plymouth Church Records, vol. 1, page 26, is the record evidence of the full settlement of the whole matter, by the interested parties:<br><br>"1696, July 16. It was there signified to the church that our brethren of the new Society were ready to attend the church whenever they pleased to appoint a meeting for that end; the Pastor appointed the church to meet on August 19, at his house,which they did in the morning, it being the lecture day; before the lecture the Pastor and three of the brethren spent the time in prayer. After lecture, there was a particular agitation of matters, and the issue was satisfying and comfortable. The brethren of the new Society professed their judgments to be, that brethren should have the advise and approbation of the church whereto they belonged, in setting up distinct worship by themselves and that they apprehended that the church had by some former act of theirs consented they should soe do; the church hereupon declared themselves satisfyed with these brethren, as to their carrying on the worship of God themselves, their habitations being soe remote from us, and that Brother Cushman might, without any offence to us, continue to dispense the word to them, and that nothing heretofore passed betwixt us in word or action of any kinde, should hinder our communion together in sealing ordinances as heretofore. The whole church, our brethren concurred, (for ought appeared) did every one of us express our consent hereunto by an universal lifting up of our hands, and this way declared to be a final issue of this matter and all differences that had thereby bin occasioned amonst us; and the church voted that Deacon Faunce, D. Wood and D. Clark should joyne with the Pastor in subscribing their hands to this conclusion, written and voted, which they did, and a copy thereof soe subscribed, was delivered to Bro. Isaac Cushman before they departed from the Pastor's house; and as a testimony of our reconciliation one with another and mutual forgiveness of all past offences, Bro. Cushman himself and all our members of that Society, both brethren and sisters, (that were capable,) came together and sat down with us at the Lord's Table on August 30 following. This church meeting, Aug. 19, was concluded with prayer and thankfulness to God for that issue with our brethren."<br><br>We continue the history of Isaac Cushman1s connection with the church at Plympton, in the language of the Plympton Church Records, --a small quarto volume, bound with parchment, now lying before us. It was written by himself, or by his son Isaac, whose writing it somewhat resembles, and who was for many years Town Clerk of Plympton. The title-page of that volume, in the hand writing of Mr. Cushman, is as follows:<br><br>"The Records of ye Church of Plympton<br><br>1714  March ye 9th<br><br>transcribed from loose papers."<br><br><br><br>The records commence with the following "Confession of Faith" which was adopted at the formation of the church, and was undoubtedly drawn up by its first Pastor, Rev. Isaac Cushman. We give it verbatim et literatim, from the original Record:<br><br><br><br>"Whereas the Inhabitance of the western part of Plimouth in ye year 1695 obtained liberty of being a distinct Society by themselves from the generall Court, having before sought to God for help and direction, did, on the first daye of Janewary in said year set apart a daye for thanksgivin -- after which upon their desire Mr. Isaac Cushman preached the Gospell there untill the 27th daye of October, in ye year 1698, upon which daye after a confession of faith and a church covenant was made, he was chosen and ordained to the pastorell office amongst them by the Elders and messengers of thre of the neighbouring churches, viz: Plimouth, Duxborough and Marsfeeld being those present and assisting."<br><br><br><br>THE CONFESSION<br><br>Was as followeth:<br><br>"Wee do believe with our heart and confess with our mouths that the holy scriptures of the old and new Testaments are the word of God And given by ye devine inspiration of God to be the Rule of faith and Life.<br><br><br><br>32ly, That there is but one only true God and that in the unity of ye Godhead thre persons of one substance, power and eternity--God the father, God the son and God the Holy Ghost.<br><br><br><br>33ly, That the one God, father, Son and Holy Ghost made the whole world and all things therein in ye space of six dayes, verry Good.<br><br><br><br>34ly, And that God mad man After his own image in Knoledg, Righeousness and True Holiness.<br><br><br><br>35ly, And that our first parents being seduced by the subtilty of Satan, eating the forbiden fruit Sinned against God and fell from ye esteat wherein they were created and that all man kind descending from them by ordinary Generation sinned and fell with them in the first Transgression and so were brought into an esteat of sinn and misery Loosing communion with God and ffalling under his wath and curss.<br><br><br><br>36ly, That God in his eternall purpose chose and ordained the Lord Jesus his only begotten sone To be the one only Mediator between God and man, the Prophet, Priest and King, --the head and Soverain of the church.<br><br><br><br>37ly, That Jesus Christ, the second person in the Trinnity is the verry God eternall of one substance and Equell with the ffather and that when the fulness of time was come, the Sone of God, the second person in ye Trinnity took upon him Man's nature, being conceived by the power of ye Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin Mary of her substance so that the Godhead was joined together in one person, which person in verry God and verry man -- yet one Christ, the only mediator between God and man.<br><br><br><br>38ly, The Lord Jesus Christ by his perfect obedience and sacrifices of him self upon the crose, hath fully satisfied the Justice of his ffather and purchased not only reconciliation with God but an Everlasting inheritance in ye Kingdom of Heaven for all those that the ffather hath given to him.<br><br><br><br>39ly, That the Elect of God are made partakers of the redemption purchased by Jesus Christ by the effectuall application of it to their souls by his word and spirit.<br><br><br><br>310ly, That justification is an act of God1s free Grace unto sinners in which he pardoneth all their sinns and excepteth their persons in his sight not for any thing wrought in them or don by them but only for the perfect obedience of Christ imputed unto him by God and received by faith alone.<br><br><br><br>311ly, Sanctification is an act of God1s grace unto sinners whereby the Elect are renued in the whole man after the Image of God and are inabled more and more to dye unto sinn and to live unto Righteousness.<br><br><br><br>312ly, That whosoever God hath accepted in Jesus Christ efectually called and sanctified by his spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall awaye from the state of Grace, but shall certainly persevere unto ye end and be eternally saved.<br><br><br><br>313ly, That the Grace of faith whereby the elect are enabled to belive to the saving of their souls is ye work of the spirit of Christ in their hearts and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the word by which allso and by the Administration of the Sacraments and prayer it is increased and strengthened.<br><br><br><br>314ly, That the visible church under the Gospell is not confined to one Nation as it was under the Law, but consisteth of all those throughout the world that profess the True Religion according to Gospell order and in the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ and the hous and family of God, and that to the church Christ hath given the ministry of grace and ordinnces of God for ye gathering and perfecting of the saints unto the end of the world, and doth by his own presents and spirit, according to his promises, make them effectuall.<br><br><br><br>315ly, That singing of psalmes, Reading of the Scriptures, the sound preaching and
