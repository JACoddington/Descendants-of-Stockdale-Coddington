<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">While living at Elizabethtown, Essex Co., NJ, he enlisted as a a Private in Spring of 1776 in a company commanded by Lieutenant Ezekiel Sayre, First Regiment, Essex County Militia. He was in the engagment at Hackensack. He also enlisted as a Private in a Troop of Horse, New Jersey Militia, in 1779 for six months, and was in an engagement at Woodbridge on June 29, 1779, where he was wounded in the left leg by three musket balls. He also enlisted as a Seaman under Capt. William Marriner, Privateer Service, and served two months, during which time they captured a British brig and took her to Egg Harbor. He then enlisted as a Private in the New Jersey State Troops in 1780, and served under Ensign Asher FitzRandolph and was at the battle of Connecticut Farms on June 7, 1780 and Springfield on June 23, 1780. He then enlisted as a seaman under Captain John Storer, Privateer Service, and served until the close of the war, and was in an engagement on Staten Island on August 22, 1781. His various commanding officers were Captains Sears [Sayre] and Asher F. Randolph (Asher FitzRandolph), Major Hayes and Colonels Jacob Crane and Crow in the New Jersey Troops, and as a privateer under Captains Marriner and John Storey.<br>   In his application for a pension, he made the following affidavit:<br>"That at the end of three years land service, he entered the naval service of the United States at New Brunswick, New Jersey and served to the end of the war as a private, cruising for the chief part of the time off Sandy Hook in gunboats and whale boats under the command of Captain John Storer.  In the service he was in several engagements and assisted in taking a British Brig mounting sixteen guns into Little Egg Harbor.  Further states that under the command of Captain Storer, they took by surprise in the night a British Transport lying in the Narrows toward the light house with a man-of-war tender and two sloops, in all carrying ten guns. After the battle, they burnt the vessels and took the prisoners to Woodbridge, Middlesex Co, New Jersey."<br><br>  In 1785 he moved to Alleghany Co., MD. (From Benjamin's declaration in order to obtain pension benefits (7 March 1836), and from documents presently held by Mr Eugene Johnson (August 2000)).<br>  In 1776 The Maryland General Assembly created the western counties of Washington and Montgomery from Frederick, and two years later reserved all unpatented lands westward of Fort Cumberland" for Maryland soldiers of the Revolution.  In 1787 it commissioned Colonel Francis Deakins to survey 4165 fifty acre lots for the veterans.<br>  The Deakins report listed 323 squatters claiming 636 surveyed lots.  Squatters living along the Braddock at the time of the military surveys [1787] included Benjamin Coddington.  Along the Youghiogheny River the Coddington brothers (William, Benjamin and Samuel) and the Frazee family (Jeremiah and Jonathan) were given preference for several parcels.  Of the more than 4,000 military grants surveyed in 1787, only 2,275 were actually allotted to veterans. Most owners sold their lots at once to speculators.  The plots sold for an average of 12 dollars.<br>  In the 1790 Census, the population of Allegany County was 4,800, of whom 258 were  black slaves.<br><br>He died on his farm on Rich Hill, near Selbysport, then in Allegany Co., but now (since about 1850) in Garrett Co., MD, on April 19, 1840.  His first wife, Annar Crane, died there on April 20, 1818, and both were buried in a country graveyard on the farm (visited by John I. Coddington in 1947).  He evidently went to Cincinnati, Ohio, after Annar's death, to visit some of his children, and while in Cincinnati he met and married Isabella Whitroh, on December 24, 1818.  The marriage was performed by D. Hayden, Minister of the Gospel.  The record is in Marriage Book 1, page 158, Probate Court of Hamilton Co., Cincinnati, OH.  Benjamin's will, dated Dec 28, 1838, probated in Allegany Co., MD, May 12, 1840 (Will Book A, folio 463, Probate Court, Allegany Co., Cumberland, MD) mentions his wife Isabella and his children (all by his first marriage, of course). (per John I. Coddington letter dated April 3, 1978) (Info provided by Mary Kay Coddington Eklund, July 2000).  He left a liberal and equal share to each of his children less certain sums already given to them, and to Jonathan his farm of 204 acres, he to pay the other heirs $2800.  He disposed of his Negro slaves as follows:<br>   'And whereas part of the property which I now possess hath been chiefly acquired by joint industry and frugality of my dear wife and myself and thinking some addition to her thirds necessary the better to enable her to live with convenience and comfort, I give and bequeath to my said wife during her life time a yellow girl by the name of Eliza.<br>  I give and bequeath to my son Jonathan my yellow boy Jackson with the express condition that he is not to be sold as a slave and if he sells him he is to be sold and to remain in Allegany Co. and only until he arrives at the age of Fourty.<br>  It is my will and desire that the balance of my negroes consisting of Nancy, Mary, Samuel, Perry, Eliza, Jerry, Jim and all others I may have that they be equally divided among my heirs residing in Allegany Co. and not to serve longer than they arrive at the age of Fourty.' <A HREF="../sources.html#485"><sup>485</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#487"><sup>,487</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#488"><sup>,488</sup></a></font></p>
