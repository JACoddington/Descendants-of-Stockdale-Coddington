<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">BENJAMIN F. CODDINGTON. <br><br>Of the stanch and hardy, pioneers who settled in the wilds of Union <br>county in the '20s none were more worthy than the ancestors of the subject <br>of this memoir, and the same sterling traits of character which they possessed <br>have been noticeable in him. <br><br>Born on a farm about half a mile north of his present farm. May 3, 1829, <br>Benjamin Franklin Coddington is a son of Enoch and Martha (Yaryan) Cod- <br>dington. The father came to this state with his parents, Moses and Amy <br>Coddington, who settled upon the farm where our subject was born, and <br>there they lived until their death, at an advanced age. They had two sons, <br>the other, David, later removing to Boone county, Indiana, where his son <br>still represents the family. Enoch remained on the old homestead above <br>mentioned, and cared for his venerable parents while they lived. Some <br>years after their death he sold the farm and took up his abode in Macomb, <br>Illinois, dying there within a year. His widow came back to Wayne county, <br>this state, and died when about three-score and ten years of age, at the home <br>of a daughter in Centerville, where she is buried. She was a child of Fred- <br>erick and Mary Yaryan, who came to this locality as early as 1818, and in <br>1 82 1 built the brick house on the homestead now owned by our subject, <br>which farm they owned and operated for many years. <br><br>The seven sons and two daughters born to Enoch and Martha Codding- <br>ton were: Benjamin F. ; WiUiam, who resides at Oxford, Ohio; Charles, of <br>Goshen, Ringgold county, Iowa; Esther Ann, who married Y. M. Powell, <br>and died at Connersville; John, of Centerville, Wayne county; Asbury, who <br>died at home, when but twenty years of age, suffering from the effects of the <br>hardships which he had endured in the army during the civil war; Ella, who <br>first married Thaddeus Green, and after his death became the wife of Dr. A. <br>W. Fisher, of Indianapolis; James, a resident of Harrison township; and <br>Melville, who died in infancy. <br><br>As previously stated, Benjamin F. Coddington was born seventy years <br>ago, and has spent his entire life in this immediate locality, thoroughly iden- <br>tified with the best interests of the county and township in which he has <br>dwelt. For twenty-two years he, lived on the old homestead, assisting in the <br>cultivation of the place, and there forming correct habits and laying the <br>foundations of his future career. After his marriage he commenced improv- <br>ing and caring for a farm of seventy acres, which he purchased of his father- <br>in-law, and this place is the fine homestead which he operates at the present <br>time. He has added to the original Immel farm a portion of his maternal <br>grandfather's land, and now has two hundred and twenty acres in one body, <br>besides having sold sixty acres to his sons. He has raised a general line of <br>grain, hay and other crops commonly grown in this latitude, and has made a <br>business of feeding cattle and hogs for the market. <br><br>On the 3d of April, 1851, Mr. Coddington married Miss Catherine <br>Immel, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth (Smith) Immel. The parents <br>were both natives of Pennsylvania, as was likewise Mrs. Coddington, whose <br>birth occurred July 6, 1829. They removed to Indiana, about 1831, and <br>were accompanied by John and Jacob Immel, brothers of Joseph Immel. <br>The three settled upon farms in Brownsville township, their homes being <br>within sight of one another. John Immel left four sons, \emdash  Andrew Jackson <br>(now deceased), Thomas J., George W. and James Benton. Jacob has one <br>son, James Benton, now residing near the line of Boone and Montgomery <br>counties, Indiana. Jacob Immel's daughters were Elizabeth (Mrs. H. <br>Stoughton, deceased), and Ella, who is the wife of W. W. Leviston, of Lib- <br>erty, Indiana. Mrs. Coddington is one of eight children, four of whom have <br>passed to the better land. Their father, a man loved and honored by all who <br>had the pleasure of knowing him, died on his old farm when in his sixty- <br>ninth year. The wife and mother survived him some twelve years. <br><br>The marriage of our subject and wife was blessed with five sons and one <br>daughter, of whom Homer, the eldest, is at home; Emmett is living on the <br>old Yaryan place; Lucy is the wife of John C. LaFuze Turner, of Greene <br>county, Missouri; Clinton is at home; Benjamin F., living a mile and a half <br>from the old home, is a farmer of Harrison township; and Joseph Enoch is <br>employed with Emmett on the old Yaryan place. <br><br>In his political views Mr. Coddington is a Republican, and he has been <br>quite active in support of his party. Though he was reared in the creed of <br>the Methodist Episcopal church, he has been connected with the Christian <br>church at Silver Creek for many years, and has been a member of the official <br>board and a deacon for thirty-five years. His daily life has been a sincere <br>and noble exemplification of the lofty truths in which he believes and ••  none <br>name him but to praise." <A HREF="../sources.html#1022"><sup>1022</sup></a></font></p>
