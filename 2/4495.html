Company K<br>21 Wisconsin Infantry. Company D<br><br>3rd Wisconsin, "A Narrative of Service with the Third Wisconsin Infantry," by Julian Wisner Hinkley. Originally published in 1912, at Madison, Wisconsin. An early reviewer went on to write, "a thoroughly organized and completely reliable memoir, based on letters, diary, and postwar manuscripts; Hinkley saw much service in both major battle areas." 197 pages, this book may be hard to find, and will probably cost around $ 150.00. A reprint is available from Higginson Book Company, 148 Washington St., P. O. 778, Salem, MA 01970. Their phone number is (978) 745-7170. (thanks to  (David Johansson) for forwarding this info. to me).<br><br>The Third Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry was the second volunteer regiment to be formed in Wisconsin during Lincoln's call for volunteers in 1861. Since it represented a cross-section of Wisconsin's civilian men, it was referred to as the "Common Man Regiment".  Not only did the regiment distinguish itself on the battlefield at such engagements as Cedar Mountain, Antietam, Gettysburg, Resaca, and the March to the Sea , it was also involved in the war's largest cavalry battle at Brandy Station and even tried its hand in a naval battle when it encountered and captured the Confederate gunboat, Resolute at Argyle Island, North Carolina.  Fighting in nearly every major engagement in the east with the Army of the Potomac , and Marching to the Sea and through the Carolinas under William T. Sherman ; the Third Wisconsin's history should offer something for everyone interested in America's greatest conflict from either theater of the war. [ex http://www.3rdwisconsin.org/]<br><br>The 21st Wisconsin was recruited and organized in July and August of 1862 under President Lincoln's call for three hundred thousand men. It was formed from companies recruited from Fond du Lac, Manitowoc, Waupaca and Outagamie Counties, and left Camp Bragg at Oshkosh September 11, 1862, and arrived in Cincinnati a few days later. The unit was transferred to the Kentucky side of the river, and there took position in defense of the city.<br><br>With the approach of the rebel army under Gen. Braxton Bragg, the regiment took part in the battle of Perryville less than one month after having left Wisconsin. Placed in the front of the batteries of the right,"they met the approach of the enemy with a withering fire, which they sustained with the greatest coolness, until overpowered and compelled to retire." The regiment lost 41 killed, 101 wounded and 121 in prisoners. On December 15, 1862, the regiment was located near Nashville, Tennessee, in the Third Division of the Army of the Cumberland under command of Major General William Rosecrans.<br><br>Company I was raised in Neenah by Simeon B. Nelson of Menasha and Abner B. Smith of Neenah in August of 1862. A story owned by William Seatoft (destroyed by fire in 1877) was used as a recruiting office. The election of officers took place in a store operated by W. P. Peckham, which a short time before had been vacated by Mills &amp; Williams. Unlike the other companies, Company I elected no second lieutenant. It was the plan of Gov. Lewis to take second lieutenants from the old companies then in the field and place them in the new companies. Edmund Delaney was commissioned as second lieutenant of Company I, but resigned the next spring. While the company was recruited, the men boarded at the Vermont House kept by L. Stowe. They left Neenah for Camp Bragg on September 1, 1862.<br><br>Following the Federal victory at Missionary Ridge, the 21st Wisconsin was marched to Lookout Mountain December 4, 1863 where it remained until the opening of the spring campaign on May 2, 1864. This photograph was taken sometime during that period. <br><br>The regiment later marched with Sherman toward Atlanta, participating in the fighting at Resaca, Pumpkin Vine Creek, Big Shanty, Kennesaw Mountain, Chattahoochie River, Peachtree Creek, Atlanta, Jonesboro and marched with Sherman's grand army from Atlanta to the Sea,and took part in the battles of Savannah, Averysboro and Bentonville, and participated in the grand review at Washington on the 24th of May, 1865. The regiment arrived in Milwaukee on June 12, 1865, and was paid off and disbanded on June 17, 1865.
