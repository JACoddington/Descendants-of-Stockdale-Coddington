He had just entered college when the Civil War broke out, and responding to the first call for volunteers he enlisted in Co F of the 14th Iowa Infantry.  At the battle of Fort Donelson, in February 1862, while carrying the flag as the color bearer of the Regiment, his left arm was shattered by a musket shot, and a shoulder-joint amputation was made necessary.  He was discharged and sent home in a dying condition but finally regained health.  He reentered college but after a short time responded again to his country's call and was commissioned a Captain of Co H of the 45th Iowa Infantry, who were 'three months men'.  He received from President Lincoln a certificate of honorable and efficient service.  At the close of the war he entered college for the third time and graduated in 1866, receiving later the degree of A. M.  He was a close student and could read the Bible in six languages.  He entered the Iowa Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1866, and held the following charges, all in Iowa: Troy, Bloomfield, Mt. Pleasant, and Fairfield.  His health failed in 1873 and he was obliged to give up active work. (per Rev. Herbert G.
