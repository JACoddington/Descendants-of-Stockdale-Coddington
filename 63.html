<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">  Joseph "1763" removed from New Jersey to Cincinnati, 1792, then to Butler Co, Ohio on the Miami River, ca. 1795.  He was one of the first homesteading settlers of Warren Co., Ohio and obtained a Symmes Land Grant in fee simple (under name Corrington), Corrington Farm in Sec. 35 of 4th TP and 2nd range between Miami Rivers.<br>"To whom is the honor of being the first settler in this township is not definitely known, as persons settled early in different localities. The forfeitures in Symmes' Purchase are explained in the general county history. The first settlers of the township located on these claims and were generally of the poorer class. Joseph Coddington and Peter Tetrick were undoubtedly the first white men to settle in Deerfield twp., Warren Co., Ohio about 1795.  He was a Pennsylvanian by birth and settled here about 1795. Coddington settled on the forfeiture of Section 35. His first home was made of bark built against a log and in it he lived while making his improvements. Having cleared some land he raised corn and carried on his back to Columbia to be ground, being gone some days at a time for this purpose.  He afterward build a log house and continued his improvements. He shot deer and wild turkeys from the door of his cabin and had adventures with the bears and wolves. He had a family of ten children who grew up, married and raised families. His descendants write their name Corrington. Joseph Coddington and two of his sons served in the War of 1812." (History of Warren Co, p. 631).<br>  "He left Dover [Morris Co.] New Jersey with John Cleves Symes and settled on a farm at Mason Ohio in 1794...In the thirties they changed the name to Corrington some use the name Corrington some Carrington, the name I have taken from his grave is Coddington...About fifteen years back I stopped at Mason and located a son and daughter of John. I went out to the old farm he did not have much information except that his grandfather served in both the Revolution and War of 1812. that they left property in Dover N. J. he had some information about the early days in Ohio and he seemed to remember that his grandfather was born in Penna., going to N. J. where he was married." (T. R. Carrington, in lit. 1941).<br>  Joseph's origins are mysterious. Two possibilities suggest themselves. First, he may have been Joseph (bapt. 12 Dec 1762, Deerpark, Orange Co., NY), son of Christopher Coddington (1731-1784). If so, he appeared on the 1791 census, with one male &lt;16, and 3 females.  Joseph abt 1762 would have had Samuel, Margaret, Fannie, and wife Sarah. If not this Joseph, the census record is unexplained. His putative father Christopher was born in New Jersey, but moved to Northumberland Co. Pennsylvania about 1766, was taxed several times, and may have died there. Northumberland Co. at that time was essentially wilderness, which explains the absence of any birth or baptism records for any additional children born in Pennsylvania. John Insley Coddington speculated that Christopher's death in Pennsylvania was the reason the family returned to New York in the late 1780's, the children dispersing to live with various relatives. However, Joseph abt 1762 was definitely baptized in Deerpark, Orange Co., New York, not Pennsylvania. The Joseph abt 1762 of the baptismal record did have a brother, Benjamin (c. 28 June 1758) who also moved to Ohio ca. 1792, roughly when Joseph (1763) moved. Joseph (1763) was in Deerfield Twp., Warren Co., Ohio by 1794-1795. Washington Co. is not particularly close to Warren Co., but a river connects them. Identifying Joseph "1 May 1763" with Joseph bapt. 12 Dec 1762 thus explains the 1790 census record, accounts for a son of Christopher 1731 who is known to have survived to adulthood (per the census record), and the nearly contemporaneous and otherwise completely coincidental migration of two Coddington men to Ohio.<br>  If a son of Christopher 1731, he must have left Pennsylvania and returned to Middlesex Co., New Jersey to serve in the militia 1781-1782, for which he received payment there in 1784 and 1785. The latter records, state say he was born in 1762, not 1763. Note that a Joseph Coddington appears in the Militia Regiment roster for Ulster Co., New York, but that record more likely applies to Joseph 1756.<br>  Second, he may have been an unrecorded son of Benjamin (1730), Christopher (1731)'s elder brother. Benjamin's first recorded child is Benjamin Jr. (bef 1765), but he married abt. 1761, so he could have had a son in 1763. Possible corroboration for this theory is that Benjamin (1730)'s grandson Isaac (of William 1769) married Sarah Hunt Kelsey in Warren Co. Ohio in 1817. Presumably Isaac had family there, which could only have been that of Joseph "1763." Under this theory, Joseph would have been Isaac's uncle. Against this theory is Benjamin 1730's will that named his children, none of whom was named Joseph, and he calls Benjamin bef 1765 his "eldest son." If Benjamin was born ca. 1765 he would have been Joseph's younger brother. He could have been born much before 1765, however, as no marriage date for Benjamin 1730 and Phoebe survives. Regardless, if Joseph 1763 was rather the son of Christopher and not Benjamin, the relation between Isaac and Joseph becomes first cousin once removed rather than nephew--still close enough to explain Isaac's visit to Warren Co., Ohio in 1817.<br>  Third, the History of Warren County may be mistaken in saying he was born in Pennsylvania, or Joseph himself may have been mistaken. The accuracy of these 19th century subscription county histories is not particularly good. If Joseph was the son of Christopher and born in 1762, he would have been three when he moved to Pennsylvania, and he might well have assumed he was born there.<br>  In Benjamin Flinn's application (S8487) for a Revolutionary War pension, 8 Oct. 1828 Joseph Coddington testified:<br>"Joseph Coddington states he personally knows that Benjamin Flinn's statement is entirely correct Joseph having served with Benjamin Flinn, knew him since he was a boy...Benjamin Flinn was born in Middlesex Co., New Jersey on 11 Feb 1763, as he was told by his father during his life-time and by his sister, who was much older than Benjamin Flinn. He was residing at Baskingridge, Somerset Co., NJ when called into the service...Joseph Coddington is well-acquainted with Benjamin Flinn, has been for nearly 50 years. Benjamin Flinn enlisted in 1781, served until the end of the Rev. War. Joseph Coddington was a private in FitzRandolph's company, served with Benjamin Flinn." The "nearly 50 years" may be significant, as that would place their first acquaintance in 1778, when Joseph would have been roughly 18.  Apparently, therefore, they were not childhood friends.<br>  Nevertheless, Joseph may have been from Middlesex Co. In 1763, we know of 12 extant Coddington families in Middlesex Co.  Of these:<br>1. Thomas (1712-) and Phoebe had a son Benjamin on 8 Oct. 1763;<br>2. Uzziah (1739-1816) and Elizabeth Loree had a son on 24 Dec. 1763;<br>3. John Coddington (1745-) and Zeruiah Bonham were not married until 1766;<br>4. Jotham (1743-1820) and Mary Millard did not marry until 16 Dec 1764.<br>5. Asher Coddington (ca. 1742-1828) was a loyalist who left for Canada in 1781; possibly he had patriot sons. His first recorded son is Asher (1766-1807) born in Rahway, Union Co.<br>*6. Benjamin (1730 - ca. 1793) and Phebe were married ca. 1761 and Joseph may have been their first child, as discussed above.<br>*7. Stephen Coddington (1769-1851) was said to be the son of a John Coddington but no trace of him survives. Joseph Coddington could have been Stephen's older brother. The descendants of both men within one generation began using the name Corrington.<br>*8. The father of Zedekiah Bonham Coddington (1769-1813) was supposedly a John (1745-) about whom nothing is known. He could have had an older son.<br>*9. David Coddington (1727-1787) and Ann Stone were married in 1750 and had sons Benjamin in 1759 and Samuel in 1766. On either side of this gap, their children appeared at regular three year intervals. However, their son Moses' detailed letter in 1807 enumerates all his living siblings including those for whom he had no recent news, and he does not mention a Joseph.<br>*10. James Coddington (1724-1773) and Sarah Dunham were married before 1754 but had sons Robert in 1760 and John in 1765. This family is quite well-known and thoroughly researched, with no indication of a missing son Joseph.<br>*11. John Coddington (1741 - bef 1768) and unknown had a son John in ca. 1761. So little is known of this family that a second son Joseph is possible.<br>*12. Isaac Coddington (1729-1776) and Sarah Giddis were married ca. 1755 and had a son John in 1761 and a daughter Abigail in 1773. The Revolutionary War service of two of his sons, Benjamin and Archibald, is well-documented. The family is fairly well-known. An unknown son is possible but seems unlikely. In summary, none of the feasible New Jersey fathers (*) seem very likely.<br>  On the whole, Joseph "1763" as Joseph abt 1762, son of Christopher 1731 makes the most sense, and is adopted here as a working hypothesis. <A HREF="sources.html#112"><sup>112</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#367"><sup>,367</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#371"><sup>,371</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#373"><sup>,373</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#374"><sup>,374</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#375"><sup>,375</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#376"><sup>,376</sup></a></font></p>
