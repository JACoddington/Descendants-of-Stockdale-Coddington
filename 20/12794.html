<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Abraham Riker, son of Abraham,I was born in 1655, in New Amsterdam, and on Jan 10, 1682, married Grietie, daughter of Jan Gerrits Van Buytenhuysen, of New York, by his intermarriage with Tryntie, daughter of Jan Van Luyt, of Holland. He proved to be a man of intelligence, and inheriting the paternal estate, added considerably to the extent of his lands, his most important purchase being that of a third of the Tuder patent, on Nov. 2, 1688. His estate he settled on his sons, Abraham and Andrew, Nov. 10, 1733, and having been for a number of years entirely blind, he suddenly recovered his sight, and almost immediately expired, Aug. 20, 1746, in his 91st year. A rude slab marks his grave in the family cemetery at the Poor Bowery. Mrs. Riker died Nov. 15, 1732, at 71. Their children were Catharine, Margaret, Mary, Abraham,3, John, Hendrick, Andrew, and Jacob. Of the daughters, Mary married Hasuelt Van Keuren, of Kingston. Margaret married in succession Peter Braisted, Thomas Lynch, and Anthony Duane, father of the Hon. James Duane, afterwards mayor of New York. She had no children and died Jan. 8, 1775 in her 90th year. An interesting obituary of this lady is contained in Rivington's New York Gazette, of Jan. 12, '75. Jacob, the youngest son, born in 1702, married may 25, 1729, Catherine, daughter of Rev. Samuel Pumroy, and settled in New York, where for many years he conducted a bakery in Beekman Street. When that city became a prey to the enemy in the Revolution, he retired, first to Long Island and then to Rhinebeck, where he died in 1778. His children who attained to adult years, were Lydia, born 1732, married Capt. Isaac Sheldon; Abraham, born 1734, Margaret, born 1740, married Capt. Abraham Riker; Catharine, born 1742, married successively Capt. Dennis Candy, and Cornelius Bradford; and Elizabeth, who married Capt. George Collins. Abraham, the only son, pursued his father's occupation, and married Oct 29, 1757, Sarah, daughter of Henry Rousby, a son of Christopher Rousby by his intermarriage, in 1703, with Sarah, widow of the noted Capt. Wm. Kidd. Mr. Rider died respected, during the Revolution. His widow, a lady of intelligence and exemplary piety, (as was also her grandmother, Sarah), died in 1802, at 62 years old. They left issue, Sarah, born 1768, married John Walgrove, ornamental painter, and father of Effingham W. Walgrove, of Dobb's Ferry, New York; Emma born 1772, married William Whitehead, Esq., late president of the Commercial Bank, of Perth Amboy; and John, born 1780 who removed to Philadelphia. <A HREF="../sources.html#5425"><sup>5425</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#5433"><sup>,5433</sup></a></font></p>
