He settled in York County (originally St. Charles Co.) in the Tidewater section of Virginia. His will and "inventory of Goodes" were probated Nov. 17, 1659 (York County transcripts 1657 - 1662 Folio 69). The will is dated Oct. 23, 1659. Thomas "being very sicke and weake in body but in perfect memory". His "sonne Thomas Bucke" and his daughter are named in the will (both being minors), but his wife is not mentioned, and presumably she was already dead. ... the charts of H. N. Buck, 1965<br><br><br>The will of Thomas Bucke:<br><br>The last will and TESTAMENT of mee Thomas Bucke, being very sicke and weake in body but in perfect memory:<br><br>First, I bequeath my Soule to God that gave itt, trusting in ye meritts of Jesus Christ that itt shall be everlastingly saved, and my body to be burryed.<br><br><br>PREMESSES:<br><br>It: I give unto Thomas Bucke, my sonne, the Land and housing and further I give to my sonne Thomas Bucke, and Daughter Dorothy Bucke my cattle and hoggs, and household stuffe to be equally divided between them, with the servants and all other of my estate to be divided between my Sonne and Daughter when they come to age.<br><br>It: I give to my Sonne Thomas Bucke and my Daughter Dorothy Bucke my horse and mare and coult and their increase.<br><br>And further I appoint Richard Smith and Nicholas Bond overseers and guardians of my children and their estate and I leave Richard Smith and Nicholas Bond full and whole Executors of ye Estate for my children, and I do appoint that my children be brought upp to learning, Read and Wright, and in Ye fear of God, and this I doe order my debts and funeral charges being paid -- confirming this my last will and Testament, with my hand and Seale this 23rd. of October 1659.<br><br>My cattle not to be transferred off ye ground.<br><br>Thomas Bucke (Seale)<br><br>Testes -- Gregory Rue Henry Russ Elizabeth W. Frie (Mark)<br><br>BUCK Family of Virginia The Rev. Richard BUCKE sailed for Jamestown on the "Sea Venture" from England June 2, 1609. He performed the marriage ceremony of John ROLFE and Pocahontas in 1614. He died in 1623. The census of Virginia in 1624 contains the names of four of his children: Benomy, Grecian, Mara and Peleg BUCK; however, no adult BUCKE was listed. These children were all less than 13 years old and members of the Peeter LANGMAN, John JACKSON and John BURROWES households.<br><br>The Rev. Richard BUCKE's first child, Elizabeth, was born in England around 1607. She may have remained in England when he and his wife departed for Virginia. Sometime after 1624, Elizabeth came to (or returned to) Virginia. She married Thomas CRUMPE about the same time; they had two children. Their descendants are believed to be the only surviving descendants of the Rev. Richard BUCKE.<br><br>Thomas BUCK I (1618 - 1659), left Gravesend, England for Virginia on August 21, 1635 on the ship "George" at the age of seventeen. Thomas BUCK was the grandson of a Peter Buck who lived in Rochester, England in 1592. Peter BUCK's grandfather was also a Peter BUCK of Rochester. There is no known relationship between Thomas and the Rev. Richard BUCK.<br><br>Some emigration records also include the following BUCKs:<br><br>BUCK, Christian, aged 26 on the ship BLESSING, to New England, 13 July 1635 BUCK, Richard aged 24, on the ship EXPEDITION, Gravesend to Barbadoes, 20 Nov 1635 BUCK, Francis aged 20, on the ship FALCON, Gravesend to Barbadoes, 19 Dec 1635 BUCK, Isack aged 33, on the ship AMITIE to St. Christophers, 13 Oct 1635 BUCK, William aged 50, to Massachusetts on the ship INCREASE, ca 1635 BUCK, Roger, aged 18, son of William, to Massachusetts on the ship INCREASE, ca 1635.<br><br>There is no known relationship between these BUCKs and Thomas BUCK.<br><br>In Virginia, Thomas BUCK I settled into York county. At first, he (or someone) spelled his name BUCKE. He is mentioned in the York county records of 1658 in a dispute over the time of service for his two indentured servants.<br><br>Thomas BUCK I died when he was 41; his wife is assumed to have died before him; however, she was alive at the time of the indentured servant dispute. Their two children, Thomas and Dorothy were named in the will of Thomas I. The will states that Richard Smith and Nicholas Bond were "overseers and guardians of my children" as well as "full and whole Executors of ye estate for my children and I do appoint that my children be brought upp to learning, Read and Wright, and in Ye fear of God" also noted was "My cattle not to be transferred off ye ground". His will includes an inventory of his household goods.<br><br>Dorothy BUCK was probably born about 1647 or later as she was a minor when Thomas I died in 1659. She married a Robert TALLANT.<br><br>Thomas BUCK II married Elizabeth Wooding sometime before 1682, perhaps around 1670 and most likely in York Co., VA. His will, dated May 19, 1729, and probated June 16, 1729 is recorded in York Country general records book No. 16, Part 2, Folio 605. He had six children but there is little information on them except for his son Thomas BUCK III.<br><br>Thomas BUCK III was born in 1682. The name of his wife is unknown but they had ten children. His will was probated June 17, 1728, and is recorded in York County general records book No. 16, Folio 532. There is little information on his children except for his son Charles.<br><br>Charles BUCK I (c1710 -1771) moved from York County into Westmoreland County. After a short stay there, and having received a bequest from his uncle Joseph, he moved westward into the Shenandoah Valley about 1735. He prospered there, and became a large landowner near what is now Front Royal, VA. In addition to being an ardent sportsman, he was a Vestryman of Frederick Parish, Lieutenant of Militia, Trustee for the town of Strasburg, Overseer of Roads, and otherwise active and influential in county affairs.<br><br>Charles BUCK I married Ann Sorrell EARLE (1728 - 1749) in 1747 in Earle Family Chapel, Muddy Run, VA. She was the daughter of Major Samuel Earle, pioneer leader in the valley, and first delegate from Frederick County to the Virginia House of Burgesses. They had two children: John and Mary. Mary BUCK was born and died in 1749.<br><br>Charles BUCK I married Letitia SORRELL in 1749. Letitia was the widow of (1) Ambrose Callis and (2) John Wilcox and the aunt of Ann Sorrell Earl, the first wife of Charles Buck I. They had two sons: Charles (II) and Thomas (V). Her son Thomas wrote of her "She was a strict moralist, and instilled into my mind a great reverence for the Supreme Being". She had children by her previous marriages but there is no information on them.<br><br>The three sons of Charles Buck I married three daughters of William Richardson and Isabella Calmes in 1774. Charles II married Mary; Thomas V married Ann and John married Miriam. These three families had thirty-two children.<br><br>The BUCK family of Virginia also has connection to the CALMES, ASHBY, BLAKEMORE, FIELD, HELM, NEVILLE, PAYNE, PIERCE, THOMAS, BAYLY, CATLETT, SORRELL and MAUZY families of early Virginia and Maryland.<br><br>Although the BUCK family is not often mentioned in history books, they were a prominent and well-to-do plantation family in early Virginia. They were active in the local economy, politics and religion of the Shenandoah Valley during the 1700's and 1800's.<br><br>For more information, check out http://www.parsonstech.com/genealogy/trees/gbuck/thobuck.htm <A HREF="../sources.html#5068"><sup>5068</sup></a></font></p>
