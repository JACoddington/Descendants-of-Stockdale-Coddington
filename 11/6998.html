<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">First Generation In America:<br><br>Edward Fitz-Randolph, baptized at Sutton in Ashfield, Nattinghamshire England, July 5, 1607. Came to Scituate, Massachusetts in the ship "Griffin" in 1634. Died at Piscataway, New Jersey about 1684/85. He married May 10, 1637 to Elizabeth Blossom, who was born in 1620 in Leyden, Holland. She married a second time, June 30, 1685 to Capt John Pike. Died in Woodbridge or Piscataway, New Jersey in 1713.<br>Page 484 through 486, Living Descendents of "Blood Royal" Volume 3.<br><br>The following article is taken from the "Genealogical Notes of Barnstable Families", pages 368 and 369.<br><br>Mr Lathrop says, "The young Master Fitzrandolphe" built in 1636, the 38th house constructed in Scituate. Having provided himself with a home be married, May 10, 1637, Elizabeth, daughter of Deacon Thomas Blossom of the Leyden and Plymouth churches. He joined Mr Lathrop's church in Scituate May 14, 1637, and his wife joined at Barnstable August 27, 1643. He sold his house in that town to Deacon Richard Sealis, and removed in the spring of 1639 to Barnstable, and built a house on his lot containing eight acres, bounded east by the road to Hyanis. In 1649, Edward Fitzrandolphe removed to his farm in West Barnstable, "a double great lot", containing 120 acres of upland, bounded north by the meadows, east by the Bursley farm, south by the commons, and west by the lands of Mr Thomas Dexter. In 1669 he and several families from the Cape removed to New Jersey. In October 1683 his widow was living in New Piscataqua, New Jersey. He is called in "deeds" a yeoman, or farmer, and does not appear to have been employed in any official station. He had received a good education for those times, and as Mr Lathrop styles him "Master" he probably belonged to a good family. He came probably from the west of England.<br><br>EDWARD FITZ RANDOLPH, bapt. July 5, 1607, Sutton-in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, England. The son of EDWARD FITZ RANDOLPH and FRANCES HOWES. Died between 1675 and 1676. Buried at St. James churchyard (now Stelton or Edison) Middlesex Co., New Jersey. The tombstone thought to have been destroyed when the British threw up breastworks for encampment. Married ELIZABETH BLOSSOM, born 1620, Leyden Holland. Daughter of "ELDER" THOMAS BLOSSOM and ANN HEILSON. Died 1713, Woodbridge or Piscataway, New Jersey, buried next to Edward in the west corner of St. James churchyard, Piscataway. <br>The passenger record entry in "The Great Emigration" of 1630 of the Winthrop Fleet lists "Edward Fitz Randolph of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts, Scituate". This gives Edward's former home and his destination in the New World. Edward is said to have built the 39th house in Scituate, Plymouth Colony in 1636. On the 10th of May 1637 he married ELIZABETH BLOSSOM. He is called in deeds a yeoman or farmer and does not appear to have held any public office. Pastor Lothrop styles him "Master"; he probably belongs to a good family. He moved to Barnstable on Cape Cod in 1639. was juryman 1641; his name appears in the list of those able to bear arms in New Plymouth 1643; sold his house on June 1, 1649 and moved to West Barnstable; moved his family in 1669 to Piscataway New Jersey, because the New England patriotism and religion were too restrictive. <br><br><br>Source of the Research materials:<br>Oris H.
