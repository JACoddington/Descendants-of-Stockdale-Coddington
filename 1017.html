<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">Enoch Conger . <br>EMIGRATION: Enoch Conger removed to Dutchess county, New York and on to Danby, Vermont. CFA I, p. 275.<br>COMMENT- CHILDREN: On page 158 of CFA I, the family of Enoch Conger is listed. His son, Moses Conger, born, Abt. 1770 in Dutchess Co., NY is not listed. He is, however, listed, with his own family, on page 379 of CFA I. Son, Coddington Conger, is also not listed on page 158. A daughter, Ruth, is listed in his will but not listed as a child in CFA I, p. 158.<br>RECOLLECTIONS: Enoch Conger, son of Job and Keziah Conger, was named as executor of his father's will, and also inherited one-half of all his father's real estate. The will was dated 29 Jan 1749, but was not proved until 17 Feb 1758, at which time it is thought the youngest son, Moses, became of age. The will provided that Enoch was to have the use of the inheritance of his brother, Moses, for a period of seven years. The will further provided that neither Enoch or Moses could dispose of their inheritance until they had attained the age of thirty years. . It is thought Enoch Conger left Rahway [NJ] about 1765, or later, and removed to Nine Partners, town of Northeast, Dutchess County, New York, a place only a short distance from New Fairfield, Conn, where his cousin, Joseph Conger, was then living. From there he moved to Danby, VT before 1770. . From Williams' "History and Map of Danby, Vt," we gather the following abstract of the settlement and organization of the town. Sixty-eight persons petitioned to the governor of the Province of New Hampshire for a grant of land six miles square. On 27 Aug 1761, the petition was granted. Enoch Conger was not one of the petitioners. . Each one of the petitioners was to have an equal share and their share, or lot, was to be numbered. The company had their headquarters at Nine Partner's, Dutchess County, New York, where the drawing took place on 5 Sep 1763. Among the first settlers who came in 1765 was Joseph Earl. The annual meeting of the proprietors was held in 1766, 1767 and 1768 at Nine Partners, and after that at Danby, [VT]. . The organization of the town of Danby, VT, dated from 1769, and in that year the first highways were laid out, and the second division of land was made. The first road laid out was on the land of Joseph Earl. Quite a number of the original proprietors were selling their rights to new settlers. The trouble over the "New Hampshire grants" was on, and was causing a great deal of disturbance. New Hampshire, the Province that made the grants, was exercising authority over them and this authority was disputed by the Province of New York. Hence the reading of the body of the deed, next to be mentioned. . These deed records are taken from the Danby Town Records. As Williams makes no mention of Enoch Conger. A deed dated 23 Mar 1771 and recorded 29 Apr 1775, Joseph Earl to Enoch Conger, "all undivided lands after the third division, belonging to the first division right of lot number 35". This was originally owned by William Barton, and lot number 47 by William Shaw, both of whom sold to Joseph Earl. . On 20 May 1772 Enoch Conger recorded his ear mark, which is a slit in the top of each ear of livestock. The next reference to Enoch Conger is dated 6 June 1776: "then surveyed and laid out for Enoch Conger, one fifty acre lot of land, laying on the west side of Micha Vail's third division lot. The above fifty acres belong to the right number 35, in the first division of land in said township. (Furnished by Harold Murton Hyde, also in CFA I, p. 158-159) .<br><br>PROBATE: Will of Enoch Conger Danby, [NY], February the 19th, 1777: In the name of God Amen. . Whereas I Enoch Conger of Danby, in the county of Charlotee, and state of New York, being low and weak in body, but in my right mind, and perfect memory, than[k] God, do make this, and ordain the same to be my last will and testament as follows: . First of all, I will and bequeath to my dear and well beloved wife Berzillah, all that 50 acres of land wherein she now lives, as long as she remains my widow, to have the whole of the profits therefrom, arising and further, that my said widow keep her family together, as much as in her power, and convert the profits of said farm to the use of bringing up my poor orphan children until the youngest shall become to the years of maturity, or to the age of twenty and one. . Further, I do hereby constitute and appoint my two sons, Job and Enoch, after my decease, to pay all of my funeral charges, cost of doctors and nurses, and all other necessary charges accrued in this my sickness, out of such part of my estate as can be spared, out of my family so left, and further, if my said widow shall think most convenient for herself to marry after my decease, in any time before my youngest son shall be of age, that I hereby order my two sons here made executors to take all my estate both real and personal, and forthwith have the same inventoried, and appraised according to law, and give to their mother her third. And then divide all the rest, and remainder of my estate equally with all their brothers, and making their sister Ruth equal with any of her brothers, always reserving to themselves, over and above any of the rest, sufficient to pay all my just debts. And this I make and ordain to be my last will and testament, according to the true intent and meaning, herein set forth. . In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, the day and year written above. (signed) Enoch Conger.
