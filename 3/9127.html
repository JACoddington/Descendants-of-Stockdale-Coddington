<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"Henry Inman later spoke of his father as possessed of a harsh, uncompromising temper, but William Inman was also a well-educated man, fond of books, and praised for his handsome handwriting and his knowledge of English literature....The elder Inman was noted for his maintenance of English ways and manners, riding in a heavy English carriage and wearing powdered hair and short clothes with knee buckles, then no longer in fashion."<br><br>"A Sketch of Old Utica<br>THE INMAN HOUSES. <br>On the beautiful drive from Utica out to Whitesboro stand the two Inman houses, very different in style and appearance, and both·very interesting. Henry Inman came to this country from England in 1792, and had charge of large estates owned by a gentleman in London. He lived first in the picturesque English cottage on the north side of the road, and, being a man of ample fortune, lead the life of a country gentleman, driving about in a heavy English carriage and wearing powdered hair, with knee breeches and buckles. The old road must have run much closer to the house than at present, and our Englishman presently becoming choked with the Yankee dust, built the large substantial looking house on the south side of the road, standing far back from the trees, and which impresses the passerby as a mansion of ye olden time. Mr. Inman was one of the founders of the old Trinity church, and an original pew holder. His sons distinguished themselves in different walks of life.  John lnman was editor of the leading New York papers of the day, such as the  Columbian Gazette, Spirit of the Times, etc. Henry Inman became an artist of note on both sides of the Atlantic.  He  at first painted miniatures under Jarv1s in New York. but gained greater reputation as a painter of portraits and genre pictures. Among his best pictures are those of Chief Justice Marshall, Bishop White, Rip Van Winkle awakening from his dream, Boyhood of Washington, etc. In addition to his talent as an artist, his social and conversational gifts were of the highest order. He became vice president of the National Academy of Design."<br><br>"...William Inman, a native of Somersetshire, England...who when a young man had been a clerk to Lord Pultney, came to the United States in 1792 as agent for Patrick Colquhoun, owner of a large tract of land in Lewis county, N. Y. After llving at Leyden and Utica, in 1812 he removed to New York City, where he followed the business of a merchant, and returning to Leyden, died there in 1848." <A HREF="../sources.html#1026"><sup>1026</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#4555"><sup>,4555</sup></a><A HREF="../sources.html#4556"><sup>,4556</sup></a></font></p>
