<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"Martha Ellen Coddington's first husband was Thaddeus Greene. He was an artilleryman in the Union Army and saw active service during the four years of its duration without even a significant scratch or wound.<br>  Three years after the war's end, participating in a patriotic fourth of July celebration at Abington, Indiana, a cannon the used to fire blank cartridges of powder exploded and mangled Greene's hands so badly both were amputated at the wrist. At that time he and Martha were engaged to be married. On his return from the hospital, he went to her to break the engagement, telling her because of the accident he would not hold her to her promise. She refused, saying "I have given you my pledge, and I will abide by it." So they were married and within a few years a little daughter, Leona, came to live with them.<br>  Greene had artificial hands fitted to his wrists. These had small holes in their palms. he had special articles to eat with, knife, fork, and spoon with tangs on the ends, these he'd fit in his palms and thus feed himself. However, he needed assistance in dressing. For many years, he was a member of the Odd Fellows fraternity selling their literature and books. He was appointed postmaster at Centerville, Indiana, and held that position for several years or until his death in 1879. After Green's [sic] death his widow was appointed postmistress at the office and held it until the administration changed in 1884.  She subsequently married Dr. Amos Fisher, a practicing physician in Indianapolis, Indiana, and resided there until her death." <A HREF="../sources.html#2422"><sup>2422</sup></a></font></p>
