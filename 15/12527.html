<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"History Of Cape Elizabeth, Maine" by William B. Jordan, Jr., 1965<br>During the summer of 1850, another important shipyard was established on the southern shore of Fore River near Ferry Village and slightly west of the Turner and Cahoots yard.<br>Early in July, Joseph W. Dyer began the dismantling of his old yard at the foot of Mount fort Street in Portland. The filling in of the old waterfront and railway construction, plus the easy availability of shorefront at Ferry Village prompted the change. By September, Dyer had transferred most of his equipment and property to the Cape. The "Eastern Argus" noted on the 20th that he had recently laid the keel of a vessel of approximately 1000 tons. This was destined to be the ship "Corinthian" that Dyer would launch in August 1851.<br>This new Dyer yard was in reality the continuation of a family trade that had now entered its third generation. As mentioned earlier, Ezekiel Dyer, a native of Cape Elizabeth who moved to Portland in 1815, had constructed the "Dart" and other vessels early in the nineteenth century close by Ferry Village. His son, Lemuel, born in Cape Elizabeth in 1786, established with his father's aid a shipyard at what was then known as Clay Cove. Also in conjunction with his father, he built a marine railway slightly to the west of the cove, which became Ezekiel's responsibility. Between 1808 and 1824,Lemuel had six sons all of whom subsequently became involved in shipbuilding. Early in the forties, his third son, Joseph W., who had been born in 1814, established a shipyard at the foot of Mount fort Street not far from his father's home on the northeast corner of what is now Fore and India Streets. After the death of Lemuel in 1847 from the blow of an Axe while cutting ship timber in Hiram, his grandfather Ezekiel having died in 1839, Joseph continued in business alone. He was undoubtedly assisted by other members of the Dyer family for in this period there were twenty men of that name resident in Portland in the immediate vicinity of his yard who were listed in the directories as ship carpenters. In addition, the family also included six boatbuilders, plus a shipwright, a shipjoiner, and a naval architect. With such talent at his disposal, Joseph W. Dyer certainly had no difficulty in obtaining skilled practitioners in the art of shipbuilding. Although he transferred his yard to Ferry Village, Joseph continued to reside in Portland. <A HREF="../sources.html#5341"><sup>5341</sup></a></font></p>
